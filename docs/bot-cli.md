# Create Bots from the command line

Bot summaries from `list` also include `lastActivityAt` (epoch milliseconds) when committed Bot messages visible to the local Human or an Assignment report record activity. It survives later Channel messages and restart; missing means no recorded activity, not a creation or Channel-visit timestamp.

`deepseekbot create` makes a new PersonaBot without clicking: blank, from a bot bundle (a directory or a zip with the same shape as the [bot-zip export](docs/bot-zip.md)), or from GitHub. It is built for external coding agents driving a DSH install, so its output is machine-first.

## Usage

```

Exactly one source per create. `--name` is required for blank and GitHub bots; for bundle imports it overrides the name from `.botharness/bot.json` (or the file name). A `--from-git` value accepts a full Git URL (`https://`, `ssh://`, `git@host:path`) or an `owner/repo` shorthand for `https://github.com/owner/repo.git`, which also covers Bot Marketplace entries through their clone URL. A `--from-dir` bundle skips `.git` as files but packs it as history when present.

`--memory-location <absolute-dir>` keeps a blank bot's Memory outside the DSH data folder (for example on another drive): the Bot's Memory repository is created in a new `<dir>/<bot-id>` folder, and `dataDir` reports that path. The path must be an existing absolute folder and the per-Bot folder must not exist yet (`invalid-memory-dir`); imports keep the default location. The create dialog offers the same choice under **Advanced settings → Memory location**.

For a blank bot, `--core-memory <text>` or `--core-memory-stdin` writes the root `MEMORY.md` (Core Memory) instead of the usual template, and `--avatar-file <image>` sets the Avatar from a PNG, JPEG or WebP file of at most 128 KiB (`invalid-avatar` otherwise, `file-unreadable` when the file can't be read). Only one of `--persona-stdin` and `--core-memory-stdin` can read stdin. A Bot can create the same blank Bot from chat with the `bot_create` Bot tool; see [Harness Bot tools without the model](#harness-bot-tools-without-the-model).

`--home` points at the target `DSH_HOME`; a fresh directory works with zero clicks. Without it, `DSH_HOME` from the environment is used. Stop the Host before offline database commands: the profile writer lease is exclusive (`lease-unavailable`). Secret file commands can run online; live commands below use authenticated Host RPC.

## Live Host commands

Set `DEEPSEEKBOT_HOST` to the running Host's loopback origin, or a tailnet HTTPS origin. Supply its current launch token through `DEEPSEEKBOT_HOST_TOKEN` or `--token-file <private-file>`, never a token argument. `--host <origin>` overrides the environment. Login happens per invocation, cookies remain in memory, and restarting the Host requires its new token. Live commands never open the profile database. See [ADR-0159](adr/0159-live-cli-verbs-ride-the-dsh-http-carrier.md).

### Online creation and headless debugging

With that Host selection, `create`, `list`, `show`, `model-presets`, `model-preset-create`, `model-preset-apply`, `model-plan` and `channels` call the existing Host owners. Blank, GitHub/Git, Zip and directory creation use the same source/metadata flags above. Zip/directory inputs are packed/read on the caller and uploaded to the existing Bot Zip import endpoint; Git cloning uses the Host's Git environment and credentials. Do not combine explicit `--home` and an online target. Failed Host calls never fall back to local data; database commands without an online adapter refuse a selected Host instead of silently opening an offline owner. Secret file commands and search remain independent. The `schedule*` commands use the Host too; see [Schedules on a live Host](#schedules-on-a-live-host).

```bash
deepseekbot create --name QA --preset <preset-id>
deepseekbot create --from-zip ./shared.zip --name Imported --preset <preset-id>
deepseekbot create --name GitBot --from-git owner/repo --preset <preset-id>
deepseekbot model-plan <bot-id>
deepseekbot channels
deepseekbot bot-attention <bot-id> --limit 20 --state handled
deepseekbot bot-sessions <bot-id> --limit 20
deepseekbot bot-activity <bot-id> --limit 20
deepseekbot bot-new-session <bot-id>
deepseekbot bot-compact <bot-id>
```

Creation returns `bot`, `dm`, the Host's Memory `dataDir`, completed/deferred `steps` and `next`. The model preset is applied through its owner, never forwarded as a native Agent preset. A missing specified preset is rejected before creation; other model failures after creation preserve the Bot and return its known identity and steps with `outcome: created`. A lost creation/import response without a stable operation key can return `outcome: unknown`: inspect the Host before creating again; no automatic mutation retry is provided. For blank online creation, use the [receipt-backed operation key](#tob-bot-creation-profiles-and-lifecycle) to reconcile the same identity. A created Bot alone does not prove model usability: use `send` and its exact correlated committed reply.

`bot-attention` supports `--cursor` and the Host's pending/processing/observed/deferred/needs-repair/handled states; it limits pages to 1–100. Session summaries are newest-first and limited to 1–100 (default 50), with `total`; activity limits its session details and reports `sessionCount`. These are bounded summaries, not full tool-call logs or streaming drafts.

`bot-new-session <bot-id>` retires an idle Bot’s Orchestrator Session through the same Host runtime as IM `/new`; the next message starts a fresh Session. It returns `{"started":true}` and refuses with `bot-busy` while the Bot is working; stop the current turn first.

`bot-compact <bot-id>` compacts an idle Bot’s Orchestrator Session now through DSH `/compact`, the same path as IM `/compact`, the Bot DM composer’s `/compact` and Idle Compaction. It returns `{"outcome":"compacted","tokensBefore":…,"tokensAfter":…}`, `nothing` when DSH finds nothing to compact or a summary would not be smaller, or `not-loaded` when the Session is not live in the Host yet (for example after a Host restart, until the next message). It refuses with `bot-busy` while the Bot has a running turn or a pending Inbox Admission.

For explicit cleanup, `bot-delete-preview <bot-id>` returns the owner's current scope and `preview.token`. Review it, then pipe `{"token":"<preview.token>"}` to `bot-delete-confirm <bot-id> --confirmation-stdin --confirm`. Memory is retained unless `--erase-memory` explicitly selects the owner-reviewed directory, and it erases the Bot's private-input secrets during the stop phase. Inspect `deletion.phase`; an incomplete cleanup can be continued with `bot-delete-retry <bot-id> --confirm`. Scope changes remain owner refusals; deletion is not content purge or complete data erasure.

From a built checkout, `node scripts/cli-smoke.mjs --preset <id> [--zip ./shared.zip] [--git owner/repo] [--cleanup]` drives the business CLI against the selected Host, checks a real reply for each source and returns owned IDs. Without an existing preset, provide `--provider <id> --model <id>`. Successful `--cleanup` deletes only that run's Bot identities through preview/confirmation, retaining Memory and any created preset; failed runs retain their resources for diagnosis. Use a disposable isolated Profile. The script does not authorize external messaging or verify UI rendering. See [ADR-0162](adr/0162-online-cli-management-keeps-explicit-host-authority.md).

```bash
deepseekbot send <bot-id> --body "Reply with QA_OK" --timeout 60
deepseekbot send <bot-id> --body-stdin --message-id human-<UUID>
deepseekbot send-status <bot-id> --message-id <receipt-message-id>
deepseekbot channel-messages <channel-id> --host http://127.0.0.1:31917 --limit 20
deepseekbot tool-approval-status <channel-id> --message-id <card-id>
deepseekbot tool-approval-decide <channel-id> --message-id <card-id> --outcome allowed-once
deepseekbot tool-approval-decide <channel-id> --message-id <card-id> --outcome allowed-always-tool
deepseekbot tool-approval-decide <channel-id> --message-id <card-id> --outcome allowed-always-kind
deepseekbot tool-approval-decide <channel-id> --message-id <card-id> --outcome rejected
deepseekbot user-question-status <channel-id> --message-id <card-id>
deepseekbot user-question-answer <channel-id> --message-id <card-id> --answer-stdin
deepseekbot ask-secret-status <channel-id> --message-id <card-id>
deepseekbot ask-secret-submit <channel-id> --message-id <card-id> --values-stdin
deepseekbot ask-secret-cancel <channel-id> --message-id <card-id>
deepseekbot ask-secret-account-status <channel-id> --message-id <configured-card-id>
deepseekbot ask-secret-replace <channel-id> --message-id <configured-card-id>
deepseekbot ask-secret-revoke <channel-id> --message-id <configured-card-id>
deepseekbot ask-secret-accounts <bot-id>
deepseekbot release-info [--since <version>]
deepseekbot workspace-options
deepseekbot grant-create <bot-id> --workspace <workspace-id>
```

`tool-approval-status` returns `status` and, while the card is still `pending`, its `expiresAt`, the time the Web card counts down to. `--outcome allowed-always-kind` is the `secret_cli` card's "Always allow this kind": it allows this call and saves a rule for the same program, account and environment variable names, which `tool-approval-rules` lists with kind `secret-cli`; any other card refuses it.

### Agent control

These commands let an agent configure a Bot's capabilities and the Host without the Web UI, through the same Host owners and checks the UI uses:

```bash
deepseekbot browser-access-set <bot-id> --enabled
deepseekbot computer-access-set <bot-id> --disabled
deepseekbot access <bot-id>
deepseekbot access-set <bot-id> --mode danger-full-access --scope chat --acknowledge-risk
deepseekbot access-set <bot-id> --mode workspace-write
deepseekbot settings botharness-client
printf '{"assignmentConcurrencyLimit":3}' | deepseekbot settings-set botharness-client --patch-stdin
deepseekbot workspace-create /srv/bots/workspace
deepseekbot group-create "Skill Lab" --member <bot-id> --member <bot-id>
```

`access-set` refuses `danger-full-access` unless `--acknowledge-risk` is given: full access lets the Bot perform ordinary work and use the Browser and Computer without routine approval cards; permission and approval-policy management still needs an individual Human decision. `--scope chat` also applies it to the Bot's own chat; `assignments` keeps it to new Assignments. `settings` returns `{ns, revision, value}` for one namespace; `settings-set` reads a JSON object of fields from stdin and applies it against that revision, so a concurrent change fails instead of being overwritten. Only fields the Host marks as live can be changed this way. `workspace-create` takes an absolute path and returns the Host workspace, whose id `grant-create` uses.

### Channels and groups

These commands manage Channels and groups through the same Host owners and checks as the Web UI. Each takes a Channel ID from `channels`:

```bash
deepseekbot channel <group-channel>
deepseekbot group-create "Skill Lab" [--member <bot-id> ...] [--operation-key <stable-key>]
deepseekbot channel-rename <channel> --name "Skill Lab" [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot channel-media-target <channel> --source-event <source-event-id> --attachment <attachment-id>
deepseekbot channel-media-download <channel> --source-event <source-event-id> --attachment <attachment-id> --out ./original.csv
deepseekbot group-avatar-set <channel> --avatar-file ./avatar.png [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-avatar-set <channel> --clear [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-invite <channel> --bot <bot-id> [--operation-key <stable-key>] [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-invite-cancel <channel> --invitation <invitation-id> [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-join-decide <channel> --request <request-id> --accept [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-join-decide <channel> --request <request-id> --decline [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-member-remove <channel> --bot <bot-id> [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-send-review <channel> [--accept | --off]
deepseekbot group-wake-policies <channel>
deepseekbot group-wake-set <channel> --bot <bot-id> --mode digest --count 5 --interval 30 [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-wake-set <channel> --bot <bot-id> --inherit [--expected-channel <channelFingerprint>]
deepseekbot group-delete <channel> --confirm
deepseekbot channel-timeline <channel> [--direction older|newer|around] [--cursor <cursor>] [--around <message-id>] [--limit <n>] [--older-limit <n>] [--newer-limit <n>]
deepseekbot channel-journal <channel> --through <revision> [--before <position>] [--limit <n>]
deepseekbot channel-mark-read <channel> --message-id <message-id>
deepseekbot channel-mark-all-read
deepseekbot channel-react <channel> --message-id <message-id> --emoji 👍 [--remove]
deepseekbot channel-search <channel> --query <text> [--cursor <cursor>] [--limit <n>]
deepseekbot channel-unread
deepseekbot channel-mute <channel> [--off]
deepseekbot channel-retry <dm-channel> --message-id <human-message-id>
deepseekbot channel-bot-stop <channel> --bot <id>
deepseekbot channel-history
deepseekbot channel-history-sources <channel> [--before <cursor>]
deepseekbot channel-purge-preview <channel> --source-event <id> [--source-event <id> …]
deepseekbot channel-purge-preview <channel> --source-event <id> | jq '{token}' \
  | deepseekbot channel-purge-confirm <channel> --source-event <id> --confirm --confirmation-stdin
```

`channel_send` accepts optional `resolve_inbox_ids`: an explicit selection of 1–200 observed Source Event or Message IDs to mark done after a committed send or successful drop. Omitting it preserves Inbox responsibility. Held/refused outcomes never resolve these IDs. When the selection is omitted, `inboxResolution.outcome` is `not-requested`: complete remaining work with `inbox_resolve` before ending the turn. Drop uses the inbound Channel when `channel_id` is omitted. Inspect `inboxResolution` separately: if it fails, repair with `inbox_resolve`, never resend a committed reply. The same parameters work through `bot-tool <bot> channel_send --args-stdin`.

If membership in the initiating opted-in Group is revoked, this run cannot redirect its reply to another Channel. `channel_send` returns `refused` with reason `group-reply-source-revoked`. A later independent DM is unaffected.

`group-send-review <channel> --accept` enables the opt-in freshness check for a local Group;
`--off` disables it and no flag reads its state. It does not change wake settings.
A direct `bot-tool <bot> channel_read --args-stdin` returns `observationIds` for enabled Groups.
Pass the target's handle as `observation_id` to `channel_send`. A `held` result is not a sent
message: read `review.content` when present. If `review.complete` is true, pass its
`review.observationId` as `observation_id` without another `channel_read`; otherwise read the
missing content first. Then pass `draft_id` with the new observation and revised
(or unchanged) `body`. At most two rechecks are allowed. Send `drop: true`, `draft_id` and an empty
`body` to abandon the draft without resolving its Inbox item. `expired`, `refused` and
`requires-review` are terminal for automatic sending. Handles cannot cross Bot owners or Groups.

After an interrupted Group send, use the same direct Tool command with
`{"channel_id":"...","body":"","review_action":"inspect"}`. This returns at most 20 own
draft/receipt metadata entries (pending first) and `hasMore`; supply `draft_id` for an exact
older record. It sends nothing and does not resolve Inbox work. After a Host restart, read the
current Channel, then send `review_action:"recover"`, `draft_id`, the fresh `observation_id`
and corrected `body`. Old observations, expiry and exhausted retry budgets cannot be reset.
For a committed receipt, read its canonical `messageId`; resubmitting that `draft_id` with the
same content returns the same message ID without a new message or Admission. Changed content
returns `draft-commit-content-changed`. Current membership, owner, source and attachment checks
still apply; a revoked Group may be refused by the direct runner before Tool execution.

For deliberate yielding, the same direct `bot-tool <bot> channel_send --args-stdin` accepts
`{"channel_id":"...","body":"","drop":true,"draft_id":"...","observation_id":"...","yield_to_message_ids":["..."]}`.
Read the cited peer answers first (`review.peerMessageIds` lists fully returned peers).
The result is `dropped` with `reason: explicit-peer-yield` and `yieldedToMessageIds`, retained
in the draft audit and `bot-trace`. Unobserved, changed, purged, own, Human or preview-only
references return `peer-answer-not-observed`; no drop or Inbox completion occurs. The Host
does not decide that the peer answered adequately. Useful additions and new direct questions
still use the existing send path; resolve only explicitly selected completed Inbox items.

`channel <group-channel>` returns `{channel, channelFingerprint, invitationPolicy:{autoAccept}, wakePolicies}` and refuses non-group Channels. Stable creation/invitation inputs and retry semantics are described under [Tob group creation and invitations](#tob-group-creation-and-invitations); Human online commands may use them too.

Renaming a Bot DM renames that Bot, as in the Web UI. `group-avatar-set` reads a PNG, JPEG or WebP file of at most 96 KiB. Invitation and join-request IDs are in the group's `invitations` and `joinRequests`, returned by `channels` and by every group command. `group-wake-set` sets when a member Bot wakes for ordinary group messages: `all`, `mentions`, `digest` (after `--count` messages or `--interval` seconds; defaults 5 and 30) or `silent`; `--inherit` returns the member to its Bot's default. `channel-timeline` and `channel-journal` page messages the way the chat view does; take the `revision` from `channel-timeline` as `--through`. `channel-retry` asks the Bot to answer a Human DM message again after a failed reply. `channel-unread` lists the unread Bot message count of each Channel that has any; these are the numbers the sidebar shows on each row. `channel-mute` mutes a Channel the way the sidebar menu does: it keeps its row greyed and excludes its ordinary messages, mentions and replies from Activity message lists and the global unread total; `--off` restores eligibility under the existing read/dismissal/snooze rules. Actual Channel read positions and explicit pending Human requests remain unchanged. `channel-bot-stop` stops the Bot's current turn, as the Stop button on the working status does: the Bot goes idle, the Channel records that the Human stopped it, and a Bot that is not working is refused with `not-working`. Assignments the Bot delegated keep running. `channel-react` adds your reaction to one message, or removes it with `--remove`, and returns the message's `reactions`; a message holds at most 20 of your reactions, and the emoji must be a single emoji. Bots react through `channel_send` with `react_to` and `reaction`, and an empty `body` when they only react; `bot-tool <bot> channel_send --args-stdin` runs that without the model. `channel-search` matches `--query` without case in the messages you can see, newest first, and pages with the `nextCursor` it returns.

`group-delete` and `channel-purge-confirm` cannot be undone and need `--confirm`. `channel-history` lists deleted groups whose content can still be purged. Purging works in two steps like the history page: `channel-purge-preview` lists the messages, Bot admissions, files and effects the chosen Source Events would remove and returns a short-lived `token`; `channel-purge-confirm` reads `{"token": …}` from stdin for the same Source Events and fails coded when the scope changed. Pick Source Events from `channel-history-sources`, which pages with the `before` cursor it returns.

`channel-media-target` acquires checked source media through current Human Channel authorization and returns its canonical Host file target. `channel-media-download` uses the same authenticated attachment route as the card, writes the original bytes to a new local `--out` file and returns size, MIME and SHA-256 in its JSON result. It refuses an existing output instead of overwriting it. Both commands use `channel + source-event + attachment` without a Bot selector or model call; source revocation remains a coded refusal. The default bound is 25 MiB.

Busy Groups allow an initial hold and at most two rechecks. `budget.exhausted` returns
`requires-review`, `draftVersion` and choices; new source messages do not reset the existing
draft. To defer, drop without `resolve_inbox_ids`, then use `inbox_snooze` for the observed
unfinished work with a time and note. Do not mark waiting work done.
For freshness-only contention, `suggestedSnoozeUntil` supplies a Host-time hint 30 seconds
ahead for `inbox_snooze.until_time`; it schedules nothing itself. A later Human deadline
or unmet condition takes precedence, and cancellation still ends the work.
An exhausted drop without observed peer-yield evidence returns `keepOpenInboxIds` for the
original request's Source Event and Group Message IDs. These are excluded from any composed
`resolve_inbox_ids` selection and reported in `inboxResolution.keptOpen`; other selected
completed FYI items can still resolve. If all selected IDs must stay open, the outcome is
`kept-open`. Continue unfinished work through `inbox_snooze`; if it is genuinely cancelled
or otherwise complete, resolve it explicitly with `inbox_resolve`. Peer-yield completion
remains available. Direct CLI uses the same checks.
The unfinished-request continuation instruction is returned even when completion IDs are
omitted or contain only FYI: resolving background work does not prove the answer was sent.
Inside a native Orchestrator turn, dropping an exhausted draft fences replacement sends
until the turn ends (`dropped-exhausted-draft-defer-turn`). A later turn can read fresh
context and proceed. Separate direct CLI invocations do not share a native turn.

After reading all required content, an answer that remains necessary may use the same direct
command with `freshness_override: {"draftVersion":3,"reason":"Necessary after review"}`,
`draft_id`, `observation_id`, original `channel_id` and the actual `body`. Use the returned
version, never a guessed constant. This explicit attempt is permitted once per exhausted
draft and still atomically checks current content. `override-context-changed-defer` means a
new message or edit arrived: nothing was sent, and the attempt is spent. Read that context,
drop without resolving unfinished work, then snooze briefly and read fresh context on return;
respect a later Human time or condition. `override-already-attempted-defer` refuses repetition.
The attempt does not bypass membership, stopped/archived state, expiry, purge or ownership.
`draft-version-changed`, `override-context-not-observed` and `override-requires-exhausted-draft`
are coded refusals, not delivery. A committed message ID proves the result; tool traces retain
the selected reason. Human requests to wait or cancel must never be overridden.

### Bot profile, roster and Part Library

These commands set a Bot's look and wake rules, arrange the sidebar and manage Custom Parts through the same Host calls as the Web UI ([#1702](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/1702)):

```bash
deepseekbot bot-avatar-set <bot-id> --file ./avatar.png
deepseekbot bot-banner-set <bot-id> --file ./banner.png
printf '{"scene":"…","seed":7}' | deepseekbot bot-banner-set <bot-id> --recipe-stdin

deepseekbot bot-appearance-set <bot-id> --recipe-stdin < recipe.json
deepseekbot bot-primary-color-set <bot-id> --color '#3366ff'
deepseekbot bot-primary-color-set <bot-id> --automatic
deepseekbot bot-source-policies <bot-id>
deepseekbot bot-source-policy-set <bot-id> --source-class group-ordinary --wake digest --digest-count 5 --digest-interval 600

deepseekbot part-library

deepseekbot part-library-import-image --file ./hat.png --slot <slot> --colors 4 --name Hat
deepseekbot part-library-add --part-stdin --name Bob < part.json
deepseekbot part-library-export --out /tmp/part-library.zip
deepseekbot part-library-export --part-id <part-id> --out /tmp/part.png
```

Images are read from a file path: an avatar is a PNG, JPEG or WebP; a banner is a 3:1 PNG; `--clear` returns the avatar to its default and the banner to the seeded scene. `bot-appearance-set` takes the same pixel recipe as the avatar editor and redraws the avatar from it. `--source-class` is `assignment-report` (`--wake conditional|immediate`), `group-ordinary` (`--wake immediate|digest|mentions|silent` with `--digest-count` and `--digest-interval` seconds), or `human-dm`, `bot-dm` and `group-mention` (`--delivery steer|turn`). Roster commands take Channel ids (`dm-<bot-id>` for a DM); `roster-pins-set` and `roster-hidden-set` replace the whole list, so pass no ids to clear it, and `roster-batch move` without `--section` moves to the top level. `roster-section-remove` needs `--confirm` and moves the section's Channels to the top level. With `--host` or `DEEPSEEKBOT_HOST`, `human-name-set` and `channel-human-name-set` use the Host; with `--home` they keep their offline path. `part-library-export` writes the part PNG, or a zip of the whole library, to `--out` and prints its file name and size; `--part-stdin` exports a worn part given as JSON.

### IM apps from the CLI

```bash
printf '{"token":"…"}' | deepseekbot im-app-add discord --credentials-stdin
deepseekbot im-app-status discord
deepseekbot im-bind <bot-id> --app <app-id>
deepseekbot im-status <bot-id>
deepseekbot channel-ingests <channel>
deepseekbot channel-connect <channel> --bot <bot-id> --conversation <external-id>
deepseekbot im-unbind <bot-id> --app <app-id>
deepseekbot im-app-remove discord --app <app-id>
```

`im-app-add` covers token-based platforms (Discord, Slack, QQ, DingTalk, WeCom, Matrix); Feishu and WeChat keep `im-authorize`. Credentials arrive only on stdin and are never printed; output lists each app's id, name, connection state and error code. `im-bind` binds a connected app (the `id` from `im-app-status`, also the `ref` in `im-status`) to a Bot, and `im-status` shows each binding's `reception`. `channel-connect` attaches an external group conversation to a Channel as context through that Bot's binding; the conversation must already be known to the binding, so mention the app there once and pick the id from the `candidates` in `channel-ingests`. Otherwise the Host refuses with `conversation-unavailable`.

### IM messaging, approvals and failure alerts from the CLI

```bash
deepseekbot messaging-defaults discord
printf '{"expectedRevision":1,"collection":"mentions","wake":"digest","count":5,"intervalSeconds":30,"identityEnabled":true}' \
  | deepseekbot messaging-defaults-set discord --input-stdin
deepseekbot messaging-grants <bot-id>
deepseekbot messaging-targets <app-ref>
deepseekbot messaging-authorize <bot-id> --app <app-ref> --target <target-ref>
deepseekbot messaging-receive <bot-id> --grant <grant-id> --enabled
deepseekbot messaging-channel-target <bot-id> --grant <grant-id> --channel <channel-id|none>
printf '{"collection":"all","wake":"digest","count":5,"intervalSeconds":30}' \
  | deepseekbot messaging-group-policy <bot-id> --grant <grant-id> --input-stdin
printf '{"mode":"follow","expectedRevision":0,"wake":null}' \
  | deepseekbot messaging-thread-policy <bot-id> --source <source-event-id> --input-stdin
deepseekbot messaging-source <bot-id> --source <source-event-id>
printf '{"kind":"mute","grantId":"<grant-id>","expectedRevision":2,"muted":true}' \
  | deepseekbot messaging-conversation <bot-id> --input-stdin
deepseekbot messaging-send <bot-id> --grant <grant-id> --body-stdin [--request-id <id>]
deepseekbot messaging-reachable <bot-id> --binding <binding-id> [--cursor <cursor>]
deepseekbot messaging-post <bot-id> --binding <binding-id> --conversation <group-id> --body-stdin [--request-id <id>]
deepseekbot messaging-post-status <bot-id> --binding <binding-id> --conversation <group-id> --body-stdin --request-id <id>
deepseekbot messaging-post-limit <bot-id> --binding <binding-id> --limit <1-10000|none>
deepseekbot messaging-revoke <bot-id> --grant <grant-id> --confirm
printf '{"kind":"policy","restricted":true,"expectedRevision":0}' | deepseekbot sender-access <bot-id> --input-stdin
deepseekbot channel-bridges <channel-id>
printf '{"kind":"add","grantId":"<grant-id>","expectedGrantRevision":2,"name":"QA","enabled":true,"collection":"mentions"}' \
  | deepseekbot channel-bridge <channel-id> --input-stdin
deepseekbot approval-routes <bot-id>
deepseekbot approval-route <bot-id> --pairing <pairing-id|none>
deepseekbot approval-test <bot-id>
deepseekbot approval-retry <bot-id> --delivery <delivery-id>
deepseekbot failure-alerts <bot-id>
deepseekbot failure-alerts-set <bot-id> --enabled
deepseekbot failure-alerts-test <bot-id>
deepseekbot failure-alerts-retry <bot-id> --delivery <delivery-id>
```

For a qualified WeChat private connector, the update JSON also accepts independent `dmMirror` and `dmForward` booleans; both default to `false`. Read `channel-bridges` first and send its current grant/route revisions with the update. The preference is shared by entries for the same Binding and conversation. Turning a switch off stops uncommitted work, including offline; it does not purge history or revoke normal reply authority. Forwarding requires an existing proactive target in the same account. For example, add `"dmMirror":true,"dmForward":false` to an otherwise unchanged update payload to enable local presentation only.

These call the same Host bridge methods as the Bot's IM settings, the Channel bridge list and the approval and failure-alert cards, so the Host applies the same checks and refuses with the same codes. `messaging-grants` lists the Bot's authorized conversations (grant ids, revisions, reception, group and thread policies) and bindings with their post limits, without target digests or app fingerprints. Structured changes read one JSON object from `--input-stdin` in the shape the Web UI sends, including its `expectedRevision`, so a concurrent change fails instead of being overwritten; `approval-route`, `failure-alerts-set` and `messaging-post-limit` read the current revision themselves. `messaging-send` and `messaging-post` print the `requestId` they used: retrying with the same `--request-id` returns the existing post instead of sending twice, and `messaging-post-status` reads it back without posting. Like the confirmation dialogs in the Web UI, `messaging-revoke`, blocking a conversation, deleting a bridge and `delete-*` sender-access changes need `--confirm`. Send only to IM conversations you are authorized to test in.

### Browser and Computer from the CLI

```bash
deepseekbot browser-open <bot-id>
deepseekbot browser-frame <bot-id> --out /tmp/frame.jpg
deepseekbot browser-takeover <bot-id> --enabled
deepseekbot browser-takeover <bot-id> --disabled
deepseekbot browser-stop <bot-id>
deepseekbot computer-status
deepseekbot computer-start --target local
deepseekbot computer-stop
deepseekbot computer-frame --out /tmp/desktop.jpg
deepseekbot computer-takeover --enabled
echo '{"kind":"click","x":10,"y":20}' | deepseekbot computer-input --args-stdin
deepseekbot computer-takeover --disabled
deepseekbot grants <bot-id>
```

`browser-open` starts the Bot's Browser (Browser Access must be on) and returns its tab and viewer URL. `browser-frame` saves the current picture to an absolute path and reports its size and viewport, so an agent can look at what the Bot sees. `browser-takeover --enabled` pauses the Bot's Browser for Human input and `--disabled` hands it back. `computer-start` carries the explicit authorization the panel button sends; read the result with `computer-status`, whose `status.detail` explains a refusal such as a missing OS permission or display. `grants` lists a Bot's Workspace Grants from a live Host. Route refusals keep the Host's code, or `host-refused` with its message.

`computer-frame` saves the current picture of the Computer desktop (Local or Container) to an absolute path and reports its size, `mimeType` (`image/jpeg`, or `image/png` when the Host cannot encode JPEG), `seq` and target. It is the same frame a paired phone polls from `GET /api/computer/frame?after=<seq>`, which waits for the screen to change and answers 204 when it stays the same. `computer-input --args-stdin` sends one Human action to that desktop: `{"kind":"click","x":10,"y":20}` (optional `"button":"right"`, `"count":2`), `{"kind":"scroll","direction":"down","amount":3}`, `{"kind":"type","text":"hi"}` or `{"kind":"key","key":"return","modifiers":["meta"]}`. Coordinates are pixels of the last frame. Both refuse with `not-running` while the Computer is stopped. Input needs `computer-takeover --enabled` first, or it is refused with `not-paused`. `computer-frame` answers `no-frame` when the Computer has not produced a picture yet. `computer-takeover --enabled` returns once any Bot Computer call already in progress has finished (at most 10 seconds), and a result that finishes after the pause starts is withheld from the Bot. While paused, every Bot Computer tool call is refused, screenshots included, so the Bot cannot move focus or see the screen while you type a password. The pause lasts while the phone keeps polling frames or sending input and lapses 30 seconds after the last one; `computer-takeover --disabled` hands the desktop back at once.

### Human Inbox, assignments, Sessions and approval rules

```bash
deepseekbot inbox --category action --limit 20
deepseekbot inbox --category replies --search budget --unread --sort mentions-first
deepseekbot inbox-watch --category unread --watch-seconds 10
deepseekbot inbox-status
deepseekbot inbox-dismiss <item-id> --source-key <source-event-id>
deepseekbot inbox --category replies --dismissed
deepseekbot inbox-restore <item-id> --source-key <source-event-id>
deepseekbot inbox-snooze <item-id> --source-key <source-event-id> --until 2026-10-15T09:00:00Z
deepseekbot inbox-snooze <item-id> --source-key <source-event-id> --clear
deepseekbot inbox --category action --snoozed
deepseekbot inbox-ignore <report-source-event-id>
deepseekbot assignment-context <bot-id> --session <session-id> --source <source-event-id>
deepseekbot channel-assignments <group-channel>
deepseekbot channel-assign <channel> --section <section-id> --index 0
deepseekbot session-ids
deepseekbot session-owner <session-id>
deepseekbot session-archive-set <bot-id> --session <session-id> --archived
deepseekbot tool-approval-rules <bot-id>
deepseekbot tool-approval-rule-revoke <bot-id> --rule <rule-id> --confirm
deepseekbot grant-revoke <bot-id> --grant <grant-id> --confirm
deepseekbot grant-write-set <bot-id> --grant <grant-id> --disabled
deepseekbot private-mcp-set <bot-id> --server <name> --enabled
deepseekbot private-mcp-remove <bot-id> --server <name> --confirm
```

`inbox-status` requests the complete message-category summary and returns `unreadCount`, `hasAction` and, on a supporting Host, `messageCounts: { replies, other }`. The categories partition distinct unread Source Events after visibility and Channel mute rules; read retained personal messages and handled requests do not trigger a message indicator. These are complete counts, independent of Activity pagination or browser filters. A legacy Host may omit `messageCounts`; missing data is not zero. The control-rail indicator preference is browser/Host-origin-local presentation and does not change this CLI state.

`inbox-watch` subscribes to the existing authenticated roster stream before its baseline read. It observes for 1–60 seconds (default 10), then emits one JSON document with `initial`, `current` and the number of `invalidations`. Both snapshots use the same Human Inbox query and filters as `inbox`; intermediate events are invalidations, not a second notification store. An interrupted stream is a coded refusal. Set `--timeout` longer than the observation window.

`inbox --search <text>` searches safe Activity summaries, Channel names and Bot slugs before pagination (maximum 200 characters). `--unread` restricts personal messages to unread entries and leaves pending actions intact. `--sort newest|oldest` orders each category; `--category replies --sort mentions-first` puts mentions before replies. Keep filters unchanged when using `--cursor`. Search, unread filtering and mention ordering require query version 1; an older Host fails with `host-query-unsupported` instead of returning partial results.

`inbox` returns one page of the Human Inbox (`items` and `nextCursor`), filtered like the Inbox tabs by `--category` (`action`, `info`, `unread`, `replies`, `handled`), `--bot` or `--channel`. `inbox-dismiss` takes an item's `id` and, when the item has one, its `sourceEventId` as `--source-key`; `inbox --dismissed` lists the dismissed items (the phone's "Cleared" filter) and `inbox-restore` brings one back with the same `id` and `--source-key`, failing on a Host that predates it with `host-query-unsupported`; `inbox-ignore` marks an informational assignment report as read. `inbox-snooze` hides an Action, Info or Replies item until `--until` (at most 30 days away), the Web Inbox's "Remind me later"; `--clear` brings it back now, and `inbox --snoozed` lists the items still snoozed with their `snoozedUntil`. `assignment-context` reads the report behind an `assignment-report` item. `channel-assignments` lists a group Channel's assignment work; `channel-assign` moves a Channel into a sidebar section (`--unsectioned` takes it out). `session-ids` lists the root Sessions Bots own and `session-owner` names a Session's Bot and role. `tool-approval-rules` lists a Bot's "always allow" rules. Revoking a rule, a Workspace Grant or a private MCP server needs `--confirm`, as the Web UI asks for confirmation. With a Host targeted, `grant-revoke` and `grant-write-set` go through it; with `--home` they stay offline maintenance commands. Private MCP servers are listed by `ask-secret-accounts`; a name the Host does not know fails with `private-mcp-server-unavailable`.

### Schedules on a live Host

```bash
deepseekbot schedules <bot-id>
deepseekbot schedule-create <bot-id> --title Standup --prompt "Summarize yesterday" --daily 09:00 --timezone Asia/Tokyo
deepseekbot schedule-preview --cron "0 9 * * 1-5" --timezone Asia/Tokyo
deepseekbot schedule-update <bot-id> --sid <schedule-id> --every 3600 --disabled
deepseekbot schedule-run-now <bot-id> --sid <schedule-id>
deepseekbot schedule-history <bot-id> --sid <schedule-id>
deepseekbot schedule-delete <bot-id> --sid <schedule-id> --confirm
```

With a Host selected, the schedule commands call the same Host methods as the Schedules panel, so the Host checks the Bot, the trigger, the time zone and the lock, and a refusal keeps its code (`invalid-input`, `not-found`, `locked`, `inactive`). `schedule-preview` returns the trigger and the Host's next occurrences. `schedule-run-now` queues a firing that the running Host executes. `schedule-delete` also removes the schedule's history, so it needs `--confirm`, like the panel's confirmation.

### Browser and Computer: observation, packages, transfer and logs

```bash
deepseekbot browser-observation <bot-id> [--tab <tab-id>] [--out /tmp/frame.png]
deepseekbot browser-takeover-audit <bot-id>
printf '%s' "<takeover-token>" | deepseekbot browser-takeover-recording --token-stdin
deepseekbot browser-profile-set <bot-id> --profile work
deepseekbot browser-packages
deepseekbot browser-install-packages --package libnss3 --package libgbm1 --confirm --wait
deepseekbot computer-install-packages --confirm --wait
deepseekbot computer-diagnostics
deepseekbot computer-logs [--bot <bot-id>] [--plugin <name>] [--entity <id>] [--since <ms>] [--limit 100]
deepseekbot computer-exports
deepseekbot computer-export [--dir /abs/exports] [--out /tmp/computer.tar]
deepseekbot computer-upload /abs/path/backup.tar [--name restore.tar]
deepseekbot computer-import restore.tar --confirm
deepseekbot computer-open-dir [--dir /abs/exports]
deepseekbot computer-webrtc [--probe]
deepseekbot browser-webrtc --viewer <id> [--probe]
```

`browser-observation` with a running local process but no owned current tab returns `viewerUrl: null`; process readiness alone is not viewer readiness. `browser-frame` preserves a stopped/no-tab refusal (404) and reports an unavailable first frame after the bounded wait as `host-refused` (503).

`browser-observation` returns the same state the Browser panel polls: whether the Browser runs, its tabs and focused tab, takeover state, stored profiles and target. The current picture is never printed as base64; it is summarized as `{mimeType, bytes}` and saved to `--out` when given. `browser-takeover-audit` lists a Bot's takeover events in time order. `browser-takeover-recording` reads one takeover and its recorded input; the token is the `takeover=` value from the takeover link and arrives on stdin. `browser-profile-set` picks the Bot's Browser profile (`default` resets it) with the same name rules as the panel.

`browser-open` refuses a machine without Chrome's system libraries with `provision-missing-libs` and lists the packages in its message. `browser-packages` reports whether the Host can install them (`access`) and the last install's progress; `browser-install-packages` installs the named packages and `computer-install-packages` installs what Local Computer reports missing. Both need `--confirm`, like the panel's install button, and `--wait` polls until the install settles. A Host without administrator rights refuses with `needs-administrator`.

`computer-diagnostics` returns the Computer's recent diagnostic events and `computer-logs` the Host's operational log entries, filtered by plugin, Bot (`--bot`), entity, time (`--since`, epoch milliseconds) and count. The archive commands work with Container Computer only (`container-only` otherwise). `computer-export` writes an archive to the export folder (or `--dir`) and, with `--out`, downloads it right away; the one-time download token is never printed. `computer-upload` streams a local `.tar` into the export folder, `computer-exports` lists the archives there, and `computer-import <archive> --confirm` stops the container and restores its data from that archive. `computer-open-dir` opens the export folder in the Host's file manager.

`computer-webrtc` reads whether a phone can call Container Computer over WebRTC (`/api/computer/webrtc`): the tailnet address and UDP port the container advertises, an empty ICE server list, and the number of open calls, or a refusal code with `fallback: "websocket"` (`not-running`, `media-unavailable`, `tailnet-unavailable`, `tailnet-changed`). `browser-webrtc --viewer <id>` does the same for the Container Browser whose viewer path is `/botharness-browser/viewer/<id>/`. `--probe` opens the signalling socket a phone uses (`/api/computer/webrtc/signaling`, `/api/browser/webrtc/signaling?viewer=<id>`), runs the Selkies handshake up to the server's offer and reports its ICE-lite flag and media candidates; while the probe is open the container streams over WebRTC, and closing it switches back to WebSockets, so a desktop viewer reconnects once. A phone reaches the same routes through `/botharness-device/api/…` on its device credential.

The Web Client's live stream socket (`/api/remote.mux`) and its viewer event report (`/api/computer/diagnostics/viewer`) stay UI-only; `browser-frame`, `browser-observation` and `computer-diagnostics` give an agent the same information.

### Debug by layer: with and without the model

Run the same task twice to find the layer that fails:

```bash
# A — through the Bot: model → Harness → tool → Browser
deepseekbot send <bot-id> --body "Open https://example.com and reply with the main heading."

# B — without the model: the same Browser tool code, Browser Access and audit
deepseekbot browser-tools
printf '{"url":"https://example.com"}' | deepseekbot browser-tool <bot-id> browser_open --args-stdin
deepseekbot browser-tool <bot-id> browser_observe
deepseekbot browser-tool <bot-id> browser_screenshot --out /tmp/shot.jpg
```

If B fails, the Browser itself is the problem (for example a site refusing headless Chrome), whatever the model does. If B works and A does not, look at whether the Bot's tool call was refused (Harness: access or approval) or never made or made with wrong arguments (model). `browser-tool` takes the tool's arguments as a JSON object on stdin, accepts the name with or without the `browser_` prefix, and saves the first image result to `--out`. Direct calls are audited with the session `direct`.

The Computer works the same way. Start it first, then call one of the curated tools with a Bot that has Computer Access:

```bash
deepseekbot computer-start --target local
deepseekbot computer-tools
deepseekbot computer-tool <bot-id> computer_list_windows
deepseekbot computer-tool <bot-id> computer_get_desktop_state --out /tmp/desktop.png
```

`computer-tool` refuses a tool that is not in the curated catalog, a Bot without Computer Access, and a Computer that is not running, with the same messages a Bot would get.

To see what the Bot did in path A, read its tool-call trace right after `send`:

```bash
deepseekbot bot-trace <bot-id> --turns 1
```

Each turn lists the tools the model called with bounded arguments, the outcome (`ok`, `error`, `denied` when an approval was rejected, `cancelled`, or `pending`), the approval decision when there was one, and the first part of the result. Arguments and results of `secret_cli`, `secret_mcp_connect` and `ask_secret` are never returned. A `denied` call points at the Harness (access or approval); a missing or wrongly argued call points at the model; an `error` from the same tool that also fails in path B points at the Browser or Computer. `--session` reads another of the Bot's Sessions, such as an Assignment.

### Harness Bot tools without the model

The Harness tools a Bot uses to talk, read its Inbox and run its Channels and schedules can be called the same way, as that Bot, with no model involved:

```bash
deepseekbot bot-tools
deepseekbot bot-tool <bot-id> channel_list
printf '{"channel_id":"dm-<bot-id>","body":"direct hello"}' | deepseekbot bot-tool <bot-id> channel_send --args-stdin
deepseekbot bot-trace <bot-id> --session direct --turns 5
```

`bot-tools` lists the tools the runner can call with their input schemas. `bot-tool` reads the arguments as a JSON object on stdin and runs the same tool code a Bot turn runs, with the tool's own argument validation, membership and permission checks; it returns `{slug, tool, sessionId: "direct", result}`. There is no inbound Channel, so pass `channel_id` where a turn would default to it. A direct read does not mark Inbox items as seen, and a Bot-to-Bot send is refused because it has no Source Event to carry Bot causation. Failures exit non-zero with a code: `tool-not-direct` for a tool that only works inside a Bot turn (starting or waiting on an Assignment, Subagents, question and secret cards, Memory branch switches, workspace grant requests, images for the model), `invalid-args`, `unknown-bot`, `bot-paused`, or `tool-failed` with the tool's own message. Each call is kept in the Host's recent direct-call log, which `bot-trace --session direct` returns; it lasts until the Host restarts.

`bot_create` creates a blank PersonaBot as that Bot would from chat: `display_name` is required; `description`, `tags`, `avatar_path` (an absolute PNG, JPEG or WebP path in the Bot's Memory Repository or a Workspace Grant), `soul`, `core_memory` and `memory_location` are optional. It returns `bot_id`, `display_name`, `dm_channel_id`, `memory_dir` and `model` (`host-default` when the new Bot answers on the Host default model, `set` once it has its own), opens the new Bot's DM and adds a notice in the creating Bot's Human DM. Refusals are coded: `invalid-input`, `invalid-avatar`, `invalid-memory-dir`, `git-not-found` and `memory-unavailable`. Run directly, it skips the tool approval a Bot turn goes through, because you are the Human running it.

```bash
printf '{"display_name":"Tim","tags":["translator"],"soul":"# Tim\\nCalm and precise."}' | deepseekbot bot-tool <bot-id> bot_create --args-stdin
```

Together with `send` and `bot-trace`, this places a failure: if the direct call works and the same request through `send` does not, look at the model's call in `bot-trace`; if the direct call also fails, the problem is in the Harness or the runtime.

`send` establishes the registered Bot's DM and returns `receipt`, the committed Human `message`, `sourceEventId`, processing `state`, and `replies` associated with that exact request and Bot-owned Session. Other requests, approval/question cards, notices and failures do not count as replies. A real reply verifies the selected model and key together. The deadline defaults to 120 seconds and accepts up to 600. No send is automatically retried. Failures after starting the send include its receipt: inspect `send-status` before resubmitting. A supplied `human-<UUID>` ID with the same body lets the Host deduplicate; a changed body fails coded. Handled-without-reply returns `reply-not-produced`; repair-needed processing returns `send-needs-repair`.

Question answer stdin is `{"answers":[{"id":"question-id","selected":["Blue"],"custom":"optional text"}]}`; read IDs and options from live channel history. Host owners apply decisions once and return coded refusals for repeated or competing decisions. Tool approval exposes allow-once and reject. Question status preserves pending/submitted/answered/expired distinctions. `release-info` only reads lifecycle information. Workspace grants take IDs from `workspace-options`.

Private input uses the authenticated Owner and the same inline cards as Web Chat. Read `privateInputRequest.fields` and the card ID from `channel-messages`, then feed a JSON object of those field IDs and confidential strings to `ask-secret-submit --values-stdin` from a trusted source. Keep values out of arguments, shell history and ordinary messages. Submission and cancellation return only `{accepted:true}`; no command reads original values back. `ask-secret-status` returns request settlement, while `ask-secret-account-status` reports current access, including revoked or superseded. Replacement returns a new blank card's `{messageId}` for a separate stdin submission; revocation returns `{accepted:true,stopped,completed,uncertain}` and withdraws local access, without undoing remote effects; the account's stored values are erased at once. `ask-secret-accounts` lists a Bot's current private accounts as `{status,accounts}`: each row has the account name, purpose, field labels, `configured`/`replacing`/`unavailable`, when it was last set, and the configured card's `channelId` and `messageId` for `ask-secret-replace` and `ask-secret-revoke`. It never returns values or references. Private-operation refusals use the static `private-input-not-accepted` error instead of forwarding Host payloads. Mutations never retry automatically; inspect status and history after an uncertain transport outcome. These commands work in every Profile: since ADR-0189 secret input needs no opt-in and no Docker, see the [ordinary Profile guide](dev/guides/private-input-ordinary.md). The [account lifecycle guide](dev/guides/private-input-cli.md) has runnable checks for replacement, revocation and scheduled reuse.

Host-down commands fail `host-unreachable` without submitting a message. Expired tokens fail `host-unauthorized`; malformed responses fail `host-protocol-error`. Bridge and gateway codes pass through unchanged. Stdout remains one JSON document (`--compact` is available); authentication values are never printed or saved.

Credential writes validate actual YAML before and after disk writes and restore exact previous bytes on failure (or remove a failed new file). Empty `refs: {}` becomes a block map while comments and records remain. Multiline values, including blank and trailing lines, round-trip. Null refs, empty stores and nonempty inline refs maps fail `bad-credentials` unchanged; use a block refs mapping for edits.

### To-do example plugin

These commands reach the to-do example plugin (`@botharness/todo`, [ADR-0203](adr/0203-bot-mode-is-a-dockable-layout-that-plugins-extend-with-dock-panels.md)). They work only on a Host where that plugin is installed; elsewhere they fail `todo-plugin-missing`.

```bash
deepseekbot todos
deepseekbot todo-add --title "Renew the passport"
deepseekbot todo-update <todo-id> --done
deepseekbot todo-update <todo-id> --title "Renew both passports" --not-done
deepseekbot todo-remove <todo-id>
deepseekbot todo-tools
printf '{"title":"Water the plants"}' | deepseekbot todo-tool <bot-id> todos_add --args-stdin
```

`todos` returns `{ok, todos}`, oldest first; each to-do has `id`, `title`, `done`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` and `createdBy` (`{kind:"human"}` or `{kind:"bot", slug}`). `todo-add`, `todo-update` and `todo-remove` change the list as the Human, the same way the To-do panel will. `todo-tools` lists the Bot tools `todos_list`, `todos_add`, `todos_update` and `todos_remove` with their input schemas, and `todo-tool` runs one of them as that Bot with no model involved, returning `{ok, slug, tool, result}`. Refusals carry a code: `invalid-input` (an empty or too long title, an update with nothing to change, an unknown tool), `invalid-args` (tool arguments that fail the tool's schema), `todo-not-found`, `todo-limit` (the list holds 1,000 to-dos) and `unknown-bot`.

### Auto approval (Approval Templates)

A PersonaBot can select one Approval Template ([ADR-0207](adr/0207-an-approval-template-lets-a-reviewer-session-answer-tool-approvals.md)). While one is selected, an Approval Reviewer answers the Bot's approvals by the template before any card is posted: Shell commands that leave the sandbox, file tools, opening an attachment, `secret_cli` and `secret_mcp_connect` calls, and Computer and Browser Authorization. For a secret tool the reviewer sees the program, its arguments, the account and the placeholder names, never a secret value or an environment value; for an Authorization it sees the device and the Session. `cautious` sends secret tools and both Authorizations to the Human; `get-work-done` allows a known program with the account for its own service, and Browser Authorization when the task needs it. Any call that changes approval policy still goes to the Human as a card.

Templates are a Profile-wide library. Two are built in and read-only, `cautious` and `get-work-done`. Every other template is one Markdown file, `$DSH_HOME/botharness/approval-templates/<name>.md`, that the settings page (Settings → Auto approval) and these commands both read and write. A name uses lowercase letters, digits and dashes; the text is at most 32 KiB, and its first `#` heading and first line become the title and description.

```bash
deepseekbot approval-template list [--bot <bot-id>]
deepseekbot approval-template show cautious
deepseekbot approval-template create night-shift --file night-shift.md
cat night-shift.md | deepseekbot approval-template create night-shift --text-stdin
deepseekbot approval-template create my-cautious --from cautious
deepseekbot approval-template edit night-shift --file night-shift.md
deepseekbot approval-template delete night-shift
deepseekbot approval-template-set <bot-id> night-shift
deepseekbot approval-template-set <bot-id> off
```

`list` returns `{templates}` with each template's `name`, `title`, `description`, `builtIn` and `usedBy` (the Bots that select it); with `--bot` it also returns that Bot's `selected` template, or `null`. `show` returns `{template}` with its full Markdown `text`. `create` and `edit` return `{template}`; `create --from` copies another template's text, which is how a built-in is changed. `delete` returns `{template, clearedBots}`: every Bot that used the template has its selection cleared, so its approvals go back to cards. `approval-template-set` returns `{bot}` with the new `approvalTemplate`. `approval-templates` and `approval-template-show` remain as aliases of `list` and `show`.

Self-escalation guard: when a Bot runs these commands from its own Shell, writing a new template or editing one that no Bot uses needs no card, so a Bot can draft a template for you. Selecting a template, and editing or deleting one that some Bot currently uses, always becomes a Human approval card that neither a saved rule nor the Approval Reviewer can answer; when you reject it, the file stays unchanged. Refusals carry a code: `invalid-input` (a bad name, empty or oversized text, an unknown template to select), `template-exists`, `template-read-only` (a built-in), `unknown-template` and `unknown-bot`.

Each call the reviewer rejects becomes an `auto-rejection` item in the Human Inbox. Its `autoRejection` holds the Session, tool, input, template and reason. `inbox-allow-once` is the Inbox's "Allow this once anyway": it covers that exact call only. The Bot is told it may retry, and the next call in that Session with the same tool and identical input runs without review. Later calls are still reviewed.

```bash
deepseekbot inbox --category action --kind auto-rejection
deepseekbot inbox-allow-once autoreject:<source-event-id>
```

`inbox-allow-once` returns `{accepted, channelId, messageId}`, where `messageId` is the Human's override message in the Channel. An item that was already allowed, or whose Bot left the Channel, is refused with `auto-rejection-unavailable`.

**Circuit breaker.** After 3 rejections in a row, or 20 in one Session, auto approval pauses for that Session: every request posts a card, and the Channel shows a notice. The next approval the Human gives in that Session, on a card or from the Inbox, resumes it with fresh counts. The thresholds are fixed. The breaker and unused "allow once" overrides live in Host memory, so a Host restart resumes auto approval with fresh counts and drops an override the Bot has not used yet; the Inbox item stays handled.

### Approval Reviewer model

By default each Bot's Approval Reviewer runs on that Bot's own model. One Profile-wide setting can name a single reviewer model for every Bot instead, for example a cheap, fast one.

```bash
deepseekbot approval-reviewer-model
deepseekbot approval-reviewer-model-set deepseek/<model> [--effort <effort>]
deepseekbot approval-reviewer-model-set bot
```

Both commands return `{follows, model}`: `follows` is `bot` (each Bot's own model, `model` is `null`), `model` (the named model is used for every review) or `invalid` (the setting file cannot be read). For a named model they also return `available` and, when it is `false`, `unavailableReason`. A model that is not in the catalog, or whose provider has no working key, is still saved, but every review then posts the ordinary Human card and writes `fallback=model-unavailable` with the reason to `logs.db`; the reviewer never switches to another model on its own. Each review's `approval-review` line in `logs.db` names the `model` and the `reviewSession` it used. When a Bot runs `approval-reviewer-model-set` from its own Shell, the call always becomes a Human approval card; neither a saved rule nor the Approval Reviewer can answer it. Refusals carry a code: `usage` (no `<provider>/<model>`, or `--effort` with `bot`) and `invalid-input`.

### Idle Compaction

When a Bot's Orchestrator Session has no running turn and no pending Bot Inbox Admission, the Host compacts it through DSH (the `/compact` path) at half its model route's prompt-cache lifetime, never before 15 minutes, so the long history is condensed while the provider can still read it at the cache-hit price. Only Sessions above half of DSH's default automatic compaction threshold for that route are compacted; Assignment and Approval Review Sessions never are. Nothing appears in the chat. The setting is Profile-wide and on by default.

```bash
deepseekbot idle-compaction
deepseekbot idle-compaction-set on|off
deepseekbot idle-compaction-cache-set deepseek/<model> <seconds>
deepseekbot idle-compaction-cache-set deepseek/<model> auto
```

All three return `{enabled, settingReadable, minimumIdleSeconds, scheduled, routes}`. Each route lists `cacheLifetimeSeconds`, its `source` and `compactAfterSeconds` (`null` when the route is skipped). The lifetime comes from the per-route value set here (`setting`), the model catalog (`catalog`, Anthropic's short tier), the observed gaps before requests that still read most of their input from the cache (`observed`; a warm gap never shortens the default, and a longer cold gap caps it), or 2 hours for DeepSeek routes (`default`); other routes with nothing known are `unknown` and skipped, as are lifetimes under 15 minutes. `idle-compaction-cache-set ... auto` removes the per-route value. Each run is recorded under `idleCompactions` in `deepseekbot bot-activity-history <bot-id>` with the route, idle gap, tokens before and after, and the compaction request's input, cache-read and output tokens. Refusals carry a code: `usage` (a missing `on`/`off`, `<provider>/<model>` or whole seconds) and `invalid-input`.

### Phone route (Tailscale)

Bot settings → Devices → Pair a phone shows a three-step guide while a phone cannot reach this Host: install Tailscale, start and sign in, then publish the Host on the tailnet. The last step can run `tailscale serve --bg <port>` for you after a confirmation, or you copy the command and run it yourself. The same two operations from the CLI:

```bash
deepseekbot phone-route
deepseekbot phone-route-publish --confirm
```

`phone-route` returns `{routes}`: `tailscale` (`running`, `stopped` or `missing`), the `serveCommand` for this Host's port, and each route with `ready` and, when not ready, `issue` (`serve-missing` or `serve-other-target`). `phone-route-publish` runs `tailscale serve --bg <port>` on the Host computer and returns `{published, changed, routes}`; `changed:false` means the route was already published. Refusals carry a code: `confirm-required` (no `--confirm`), `tailscale-missing`, `tailscale-stopped`, `serve-other-target` (another service is already published at this address; the Host never replaces it, change it by hand), `serve-needs-enable` (Serve is off for the tailnet; the refusal carries `enableUrl` for the Tailscale admin console), `serve-denied` (Tailscale refused the change for this OS user) and `serve-failed`. Undo with `tailscale serve reset`.

### Models, usage and activity

```bash
deepseekbot model-catalog
printf '%s' "$PLAN_JSON" | deepseekbot model-plan-set <bot-id> --plan-stdin
deepseekbot model-plan-customize <bot-id> --orchestrator-provider deepseek --orchestrator-model deepseek-reasoner
printf '%s' "$ASSIGNMENTS_JSON" | deepseekbot model-plan-assignments-set <bot-id> --plan-stdin
deepseekbot model-plan-inherit <bot-id>
deepseekbot model-preset-update <preset-id> --name Nightly --orchestrator-effort high
deepseekbot home-model-set --provider <provider-id> --model <model-id> [--orchestrator-effort <effort>] [--expected-revision <default-revision>]
deepseekbot model-preset-apply <bot-id> --preset <preset-id> [--expected-revision <plan-revision>] [--preset-revision <preset-revision>]
deepseekbot overview-usage --period week
deepseekbot overview-memory
deepseekbot activity-overview
deepseekbot channel-activity-today
deepseekbot bot-usage <bot-id> --start 2026-10-01 --end 2026-10-14 [--purpose assignment] [--model <m>] [--provider <p>]
deepseekbot bot-session-usage <bot-id>
deepseekbot bot-activity-history <bot-id> [--before 2026-10-14] [--weeks 26]
deepseekbot group-activity <group-channel>
```

`model-preset-create` also accepts `--plan-stdin` against an online Host, with only `{"assignmentModels":[...]}` in stdin, to preserve allowed models, reasoning efforts and notes when creating a preset. Creation and update forward the complete policy through the same Host bridge as the mobile editor; neither silently reduces it to the default model.

`model-catalog` lists the models the Host can run and the Profile default, as the model pickers do. `model-plan-set` replaces a Bot's whole plan with stdin `{"orchestrator":{...},"assignmentDefault":{...},"assignmentModels":[...]}`; `model-plan-assignments-set` takes the same object without `orchestrator`. A route is `{"provider","model","reasoningEffort"?}` and an Assignment model is `{"provider","model","allowedEfforts":[...],"defaultEffort","note"?}`. `model-plan-customize` changes only the Bot’s Orchestrator, creating an independent override if necessary while preserving fixed or inherited Assignment settings. `model-plan-inherit` drops the Bot's own model so it follows the Profile default. `model-preset-update` changes a preset's name or routes; flags you leave out keep the current values, and an optional `--plan-stdin` `{"assignmentModels":[...]}` replaces its Assignment models. The Host validates every route against its catalog. Plan and preset writes check a revision: `--expected-revision` makes that check explicit; without it the command reads the current revision first, like `memory-save` does with `--expected-head`. A plan changed meanwhile fails with the Host's `invalid-input`.

The online Human CLI accepts `home-model-set --orchestrator-effort` and `--expected-revision`; the latter names `model-catalog.defaultRevision`, or the command reads the current default revision when omitted. `model-preset-apply` accepts `--expected-revision` for the Bot plan and `--preset-revision` for the preset; omitting these retains the existing Human behavior. Scoped Tob calls require the corresponding explicit revisions and cannot omit them to bypass the reviewed snapshot.

`overview-usage` (`--period today|week|month|quarter`; `month` is the last 28 days and `quarter` the last 84, default `today`) and `overview-memory` return the Overview page's per-Bot rows; pass `nextCursor` back as `--after` for more. In `overview-usage`, each bucket is the sum of what providers reported and is `null` only when nothing in it was reported; `partial: true` on the totals, a day or a Bot means some usage in it went unreported, so its `totalTokens` is a lower bound. `activity-overview` shows what every Bot is doing and `channel-activity-today` today's messages per Channel. The `bot-*` readers address a Bot by id and read the Profile panels through its DM: `bot-usage` needs a non-future `--start`/`--end` range shorter than 182 days, `bot-session-usage` groups usage by Session and Assignment, and `bot-activity-history` returns the activity calendar (`--weeks` 1–104). `group-activity` takes a group Channel id. In `bot-activity-history`, a model row’s `totalTokens` retains the reported lower bound with `partial: true` when other calls are unreported; fully unreported usage stays `null`. The strict `bot-usage` query retains its existing unknown-total semantics.

### Marketplace, releases, usage statistics, Git and pairing review

These commands call the same Host methods as the Marketplace page, the update card, the usage statistics notice, the Git prompt and the IM pairing panel:

```bash
deepseekbot marketplace-list [--query <words>] [--topic <topic>] [--sort updated|stars] [--lang zh|en] [--cursor <next-cursor>]
deepseekbot marketplace-topics
deepseekbot marketplace-detail <owner/repo> [--lang zh|en]
deepseekbot marketplace-submit https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>
deepseekbot marketplace-report <owner/repo> [--reason <text>]
deepseekbot release-check [--force]
deepseekbot release-install <version> --confirm
deepseekbot release-restart --confirm
deepseekbot telemetry-status
deepseekbot telemetry-set --enabled | --disabled
deepseekbot git-status
deepseekbot git-install
deepseekbot pairing-list <bot-id>
deepseekbot pairing-review <bot-id> <pairing-id> --decision approve --role <role-id>
deepseekbot pairing-review <bot-id> <pairing-id> --decision approve --capability approve [--capability answer ...]
deepseekbot pairing-review <bot-id> <pairing-id> --decision approve --capability manage-profile --confirm
deepseekbot pairing-review <bot-id> <pairing-id> --decision reject
deepseekbot pairing-review <bot-id> <pairing-id> --decision revoke --confirm
```

`release-check --force` bypasses the Host check cache. `available` includes native DSH compatibility and may expose `blockedLatest` when a newer release is incompatible; `blocked` carries incompatible requirements or an unknown-runtime/metadata reason. Compatibility covers the exact Bundle, first-party components and its pinned IM Provider using the running DSH evaluator. Installation rechecks metadata and still uses the native Plugin Manager for final admission. A cached/offline failure is never “up to date”.

`release-info` includes an optional Host-owned `identity`: `development` with source revision/dirty state, `release` with version, or `unknown` with a metadata/composition reason. Old Hosts omit this field; absence is not verified release identity. The internal source version placeholder remains `0.0.0`; About displays source identity instead. `release-check` can return `unknown`; install/restart then refuse with `release-identity-invalid`. Installed/staged and running versions remain separate until the new Host answers with the exact target version.

`--lang zh|en` asks for listings in that language, as the Marketplace page does in the interface language: the name and bio come from the author's `bot.json` `i18n` translation, then a bio already in that language, then the Marketplace's generated summary (`descriptionGenerated: true`); `marketplace-detail` returns the repository's README in that language and names it in `readmeLanguage`, else `README.md`: for `zh` it takes `README.zh-CN.md`, then `README.zh.md`, then another spelling such as `README_CN.md` or `README-zh.md`; for `en` it takes `README.en.md`. `marketplace-submit` and `marketplace-report` first solve the Host's proof-of-work challenge, as the Web page does, so they can take a few seconds; the Marketplace's own refusals (`repository-missing-topic`, `rate-limited`, …) come back as the error code. A report reason is at most 500 characters. `release-check` returns the update status (`current`, `available`, `restart-required`, `blocked`, `development`, `unknown` or `unavailable`). `release-install` and `release-restart` need `--confirm`; a failed install or restart exits non-zero with `release-<reason>`, such as `release-network` or `release-not-pending`. Restarting stops every running Bot turn, so do it only on a Host you own. `pairing-list` shows a Bot's pairing requests and its roles; `pairing-review` reads the current revisions itself, so a request that changed in between is refused instead of overwritten. Approve with one `--role` for a conversation request or with `--capability` for a management request.

## IM application authorization

Use the same live Host authentication described above. `im-apps` discovers compatible Feishu and WeChat flows; it does not expose account credentials. The isolated development launcher can install the qualified Provider with `--im-provider`.

```bash
deepseekbot im-apps
deepseekbot im-authorize weixin
deepseekbot pairing-status <attempt-id>
deepseekbot pairing-status <attempt-id> --wait --timeout 120
deepseekbot im-authorize feishu
deepseekbot im-credentials <attempt-id> --credentials-stdin < /private/app-credentials.json
deepseekbot im-verify <attempt-id> --verification-stdin < /private/phone-code.txt
deepseekbot im-cancel <attempt-id>
```

Feishu credential stdin is JSON with exactly `appId`, `appSecret` and `domain` (`feishu` or `lark`); app IDs start with `cli_`. Keep input files private, or feed stdin directly from a secret manager. WeChat returns a nonsecret `authorization.qrDataUrl` PNG and `next` prompts: display the data URL, scan and confirm it on a phone, then poll the returned `attemptId`. If the state is `needs_verification`, submit the 4–8 digit phone code through stdin. Neither secret belongs in a command argument or chat transcript.

The Provider owns attempts and native accounts. Attempts last at most ten minutes and do not survive Host restart; the Provider QR can expire sooner, so use the returned state and expiresAt. `--wait` stops at `ready`, `credentials` or `needs_verification`; on `authorization-timeout`, poll the same attempt again. Completed output includes the native account reference, fingerprint and actual connection status. `setup-expired` requires a new attempt; terminal states fail `authorization-expired`, `authorization-failed` or `authorization-cancelled`. Cancellation acknowledges the attempt and does not revoke an already authorized account. A failed start without an attempt ID has an unknown outcome: inspect Provider status before retrying.

IM application authorization does not choose a PersonaBot or create a conversation Grant. `pairing-status` polls this Provider attempt; `pairings <bot-id>` lists the Bot's administrator pairing requests. Provider locality checks can be stricter than the CLI's tailnet carrier. See [ADR-0161](adr/0161-cli-im-authorization-keeps-provider-attempt-authority.md).

## Machine contract

`send` waits until the request is handled before returning its committed replies, so sequential commands do not steer a still-running previous turn. Concurrent same-Bot sends retain the Host's DM delivery policy; a handled request with no attributable reply fails honestly. To repeat the live soak on an isolated, model-authorized QA Bot, run `node scripts/e2e-cli-live.mjs --launch <private-launch.json> --bot <id> --rounds 8 --interval-seconds 30 --output <private-report.json>` after `pnpm build`. Use interval `0` to verify immediate sequential sends.

Stdout carries exactly one JSON document. Success exits 0:

```json
{
  "bot": { "id": "bot-…", "name": "…" },
  "dm": { "channelId": "dm-bot-…" },
  "dataDir": "<dsh-home>/botharness/bots/bot-…/memory",
  "steps": [{ "name": "create-bot", "status": "ok" }],
  "next": ["Open DM dm-bot-… in the DSH web client …"]
}
```

Failure exits non-zero with `{"error": {"code", "message"}}` using a stable code (`usage`, `secret-in-argv`, `bad-zip`, `bad-bundle`, `bad-ref`, `bad-credentials`, `unknown-preset`, `unknown-bot`, `unknown-channel`, `unknown-schedule`, `duplicate-preset`, `git-not-found`, `git-clone-failed`, `git-clone-timeout`, `memory-unavailable`, `memory-conflict`, `memory-unknown-commit`, `not-found`, `invalid-grant`, `locked`, `inactive`, `limit-reached`, `lease-unavailable`, `invalid-input`). Human-readable lines go to stderr only, so stdout stays parseable in both cases. Stdout JSON is pretty-printed by default; `--compact` condenses it to one line. `search` finds commands by words against the same verb table the CLI dispatches.

## Identity

The bot name is a label; identity is the id. Without an operation key, every create mints a new bot, so reusing a name returns a second bot and still exits 0. A stable online operation key instead reconciles its original identity.

## Secrets

Never pass secrets as arguments: any `--api-key` / `--token` / `--secret` / `--password` style flag is a hard error (`secret-in-argv`). Model keys and tokens travel in the environment (for example `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`) or a stdin pipe (`--persona-stdin`); result JSON never contains secret values.

`secret-put <NAME>` reads the value from stdin only and writes that entry under top-level `refs:` in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`, keeping every other byte intact; a backup is taken first and the write is re-read before it counts. `secret-list` reports names, sources, and writability, never values. `secret-unset <NAME>` deletes the entry. Malformed stores and wide-open file modes fail coded (`bad-credentials`). See ADR-0158.

## Models

Without `--preset`, creation still succeeds and the `model` step reports `no-model-yet`: authorize a model in Bot-mode Settings, then message the Bot to verify a live reply. With `--preset <model-preset-id>`, that preset is applied at creation; an unknown id fails with `unknown-preset` before any bot is minted.

The model verbs manage the same records afterwards: `model-presets` lists the profile presets, `model-preset-create` mints one from explicit provider/model routes, `model-preset-apply` puts it on a Bot, and `model-plan` shows the active plan. Routes are shape-checked plus provider-existence-checked offline (unknown providers fail fast); catalog liveness and readiness inspection stay Host-side, so `model-plan` reports readiness deferred. See ADR-0157.

## Lifecycle and human naming

`pause` and `resume` gate a Bot's execution; `update` relabels it (`--name`, `--description`, `--role`, within the profile tag/bio limits). `human-name-set` writes the Human display name (`--clear` resets it) and `channel-human-name-set` writes the per-channel Human nickname, using the CONTEXT.md terms. Unknown bots and channels fail coded (`unknown-bot`, `unknown-channel`).

## Channels, grants, schedules, pairings

`channels` lists channels and `channel-messages` reads one page newest-first (`--limit`, `--before`). `grants` lists a Bot's workspace grants while `grant-revoke` and `grant-write-set` manage them; creating a grant needs the Host workspace registry and stays a Host-side action. `schedules` lists a Bot's schedules; `schedule-create` takes `--title`, `--prompt`, and exactly one trigger (`--every` seconds, `--daily`/`--weekly` time plus `--weekdays`, `--once-date` plus `--once-time`, or `--cron`), with `--timezone` required for calendar triggers; `schedule-update`/`schedule-delete`/`schedule-history` address a schedule by `--sid`; `schedule-run-now` records a manual firing that the Host executes on start; `schedule-preview` renders upcoming occurrences for a trigger without a bot. `pairings` lists a Bot's IM pairing requests. Missing schedules fail `unknown-schedule`; deleting one reports `removed`.

### Approve one Workspace request online

```bash
deepseekbot inbox --category action --bot <bot-id>
deepseekbot workspace-options
deepseekbot grant-request-approve <bot-id> --channel <channel-id> --request <message-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --confirm
deepseekbot grants <bot-id>
```

`grant-request-approve` uses the same Owner-only Host command as the Web request card. The Host commits persistent read/write authority and the Grant-linked resolution together before continuing the original task through its existing Inbox. It also upgrades an existing read-only Grant after this explicit confirmation. Repeating the same approved request reads back the existing decision; it does not create another Grant or wake. A revoked or changed target is refused. An old tool approval is not a Workspace request: use this command rather than `tool-approval-decide`. Missing `--confirm` is `usage`; unavailable or stale authority returns a coded refusal. This is an online command, not an offline database repair.

## Memory

`memory-snapshot`, `memory-file --path`, `memory-history [--limit]`, and `memory-diff --sha` read the Bot memory store; `memory-save --path (--body | --body-stdin)` writes one file and commits it. `--expected-head` defaults to the current HEAD (pass it explicitly for compare-and-swap); `--edit-id` defaults to a fresh UUID and makes repeat submissions idempotent. A stale head or a no-change write fails with `memory-conflict`, a missing file reads back `null`, and malformed shas fail `invalid-input`.

With a live Host selected, the same commands go through the Host's Memory owner instead of the local store, and `memory-save` then requires `--expected-head`. The live Host also offers the rest of the Memory panel:

```bash
deepseekbot memory-graph <bot-id> [--offset <n>]
deepseekbot memory-commit-diff <bot-id> --sha <commit>
deepseekbot memory-changes <bot-id>
deepseekbot memory-working-diff <bot-id> --path <file> --kind staged|unstaged|untracked|current
deepseekbot memory-file-target <bot-id> --path <file>
deepseekbot memory-versions <bot-id>
deepseekbot memory-version-name <bot-id> --sha <commit> --name <version>
deepseekbot memory-version-unname <bot-id> --tag <version>
deepseekbot memory-checkpoints <bot-id>
deepseekbot memory-restore <bot-id> --checkpoint <id> --expected-current <id>
deepseekbot memory-restore-commit <bot-id> --sha <commit> --expected-head <commit> [--name <version>]
deepseekbot memory-repair <bot-id> --expected-head <commit>
```

Writes and restores always name the head or checkpoint they expect, so a concurrent change fails with `memory-conflict` instead of being overwritten; `--restore-id` and `--repair-id` default to fresh UUIDs and make a retry idempotent. A restore records a checkpoint first, which `memory-checkpoints` lists.

To move a Bot's Memory repository to another folder, or back to the default one:

```bash
deepseekbot memory-move <bot-id> --memory-location <absolute-dir>
deepseekbot memory-move <bot-id> --default-location
```

The repository moves to `<absolute-dir>/<bot-id>`; the folder must already exist and must not already hold that Bot. The Bot's main session is archived first, so its next turn starts a new main session in the new folder; history, Memory commits and assignments stay. The move is refused with `bot-busy` while the Bot is working, `invalid-memory-dir` for a missing or occupied folder, and `memory-conflict` while a Memory repair is unfinished. Across drives the files are copied, checked against the original HEAD, then the old folder is removed; a `leftover` path in the result names an old folder that could not be removed.

## Home and Tob

`deepseekbot tob-home` prepares/reuses the protected local Tob identity, Memory, managed Workspace and DM, returning their IDs and the canonical attention summary. It does not send a message. `deepseekbot home-model-set --provider <id> --model <id>` updates the native Host default; independent Bot plans remain unchanged.

Tob uses the normal native bash/pwsh Tool to call `deepseekbot`; the dedicated `tob_assignment_limit_read` and `tob_assignment_limit_set` Tools and their direct-runner entries are removed. Existing Assignment Tools are unchanged. The scoped journey supports the Bot creation/profile/lifecycle, group creation/invitation, group settings/member removal, invitation cancellation/join decisions, model, runtime, privacy, Git and update operations listed below; it is an explicit allowlist, not blanket access to every Human CLI command or other Bots' data.

Tob's Host-supplied system guidance is bundled with the plugin and is installed only for the protected Tob Orchestrator; upgrades do not overwrite the Human's editable personality or Memory. A simple question such as “What can you do?” first discovers the installed CLI capabilities, then describes practical outcomes in the Human's language and offers a concrete next step. Capability questions are read-only: they do not propose a mutation or approval. A later specific change request still goes through the existing authority and approval checks.

The npm Bundle ships the core CLI module and product CLI entry. Tob uses a managed executable injected into its eligible Shell environment; it does not depend on a global `deepseekbot`, a source checkout, or manually copied skill files. Missing packaged CLI entries fail release verification; an unavailable runtime CLI is reported rather than replaced with an administrative fallback.

Inside an eligible Tob Shell execution:

```bash
deepseekbot capabilities
deepseekbot settings botharness-client
# Use the previous value and revision returned by the read, not these example values.
printf '%s' '{"assignmentConcurrencyLimit":3}' | deepseekbot settings-set botharness-client --patch-stdin --expected-revision 12 --previous-value '{"assignmentConcurrencyLimit":8}'
```

`capabilities` (also scoped `--help`) reports supported commands, fields, required review inputs and coded refusals. The read returns `{scope, ns, revision, value}`; `value` contains only the allowed fields. The write goes through existing Host approval policy for the parsed namespace, previous value, proposed value and revision. It rechecks the actual Tob root Orchestrator and the exact accepted Human DM source before and after approval and at execution, then reads back the native Settings value. Group requests, unverified external IM requests, Bot-originated input, Assignment Sessions and caller-supplied identities cannot grant this authority. An expressly authorized same-Human WeChat DM may qualify through the pairing flow below; the transport alone never grants access.

The Host supplies an ephemeral loopback endpoint and scoped token to this Shell's child environment. This is a short-lived bearer capability, not a Human administrator credential or an isolation boundary against the same OS user; do not print or persist it. It expires when the Shell finishes, aborts or is disposed. Unsupported commands/options, incomplete scoped context and attempts to select another Host, token or offline home refuse rather than falling back to Human/offline access. `stale-setting` requires a new read and proposal; `agent-write-uncertain`, `setting-outcome-uncertain` and `setting-readback-mismatch` require read-back before any retry. A fresh Shell execution is required after context expiry.

Authenticated Human `settings-set` keeps its existing behavior. It additionally accepts the paired `--expected-revision` and `--previous-value` flags to apply a previously reviewed patch; the latter is a JSON object with the same fields as the patch. Omitting both retains the existing read-then-write flow. Tob deletion/archiving still refuses with `protected-bot`.

The [UI/CLI coverage inventory](agents/cli-ui-coverage.md) distinguishes existing Human commands from scoped Tob access and tracks the remaining coverage work. See [ADR-0224](adr/0224-tob-management-uses-scoped-native-shell-cli.md) for authority and lifecycle boundaries.

### Verified Human WeChat management DMs

WeChat's paired account owner is not automatically the local Human. Do not approve a contact because of their display name, ordinary sender access or a message claiming to be the owner. Only the authenticated Host Human can explicitly authorize the same Human's exact WeChat account and sender; Tob cannot grant this through its scoped CLI.

1. Send the literal `/pair` in the owner's WeChat DM to Tob. This creates a pending management request, not management access; ordinary message admission stays unchanged.
2. In the authenticated Human online CLI, run `deepseekbot pairing-list <tob-id>`. Independently verify the person and inspect the request's `bindingId`, `accountRef`, `fingerprint`, `actorId` and `conversationId`. The request must target this Tob and this account's direct conversation with that sender.
3. Approve that exact pending request with the sole capability `manage-profile` and explicit confirmation:

   ```bash
   deepseekbot pairing-review <tob-id> <pairing-id> --decision approve --capability manage-profile --confirm
   ```

4. Send a **new** management message in that WeChat DM after approval. Pre-approval Source Events are never retroactively promoted. Tob may then use only its existing scoped commands, with the same native approval, revision, cancellation and stop checks as the local Human DM.
5. Revoke through the existing Web pairing controls or authenticated Human CLI:

   ```bash
   deepseekbot pairing-review <tob-id> <pairing-id> --decision revoke --confirm
   ```

This slice grants through the authenticated CLI only, not a new Web grant control or a WeChat approval button. It stores the confirmation in the existing management pairing, bound to the account fingerprint, sender and DM; it adds no Role, Permission Group or general Human identity directory. Every accepted source in the Tob turn must qualify independently: groups, Ingest, borrowed sources and unverified contacts cannot inherit the grant. A changed/revoked Binding, Grant, pairing revision or Consumer lease invalidates a captured Shell authority. `human-management-required` means the external source lacks valid authorization; `human-management-stale` means captured authorization no longer matches. The response scope remains `current-human-dm-shell` for compatibility and includes an expressly verified Human DM regardless of transport; it is not blanket IM administration.

### Tob Bot creation, profiles and lifecycle

`create` in scoped Tob execution makes a blank Bot in managed Memory storage. A name is the only required user choice; Tob supplies a stable `--operation-key` for the operation. Optional `--description`, repeated `--role` tags, `--avatar-file`, `--persona` / `--persona-stdin`, and `--core-memory` / `--core-memory-stdin` reuse the existing creation validation. Only one content option may consume stdin. Initial personality and Memory become `SOUL.md` and `MEMORY.md`; no unrelated Workspace Grants or credentials are copied.

```bash
deepseekbot create --name Translator --operation-key create-translator-001 --persona 'Translate clearly.' --core-memory 'Prefer concise explanations.'
deepseekbot show <bot-id>
deepseekbot update <bot-id> --expected-profile <profileFingerprint> --name Translator --description 'Translation assistant' --role translator
deepseekbot pause <bot-id> --expected-profile <profileFingerprint>
deepseekbot resume <bot-id> --expected-profile <profileFingerprint>
```

The Host reserves one identity in its durable creation receipt before creating the Memory Repository and DM. After a lost response, repeat the **same operation key and same payload**: an existing completed receipt returns that Bot and DM, while a partially completed operation reconciles the reserved identity. A completed scoped retry performs a checked read instead of another creation approval. A changed payload refuses with `creation-key-conflict`; an archived or deleted identity refuses with `creation-identity-unavailable` and is never recreated by replay. `creation-memory-conflict` means the reserved folder exists without its Registry identity: preserve it for repair rather than deleting it or trying a new key. Receipt-backed creation is not a filesystem/database transaction and does not promise automatic repair of that interrupted state.

The authenticated Human online `create` also accepts `--operation-key`. It is limited to blank creation with managed Memory, without `--preset` or a custom Memory location; apply a model plan or move Memory separately. Calls without a key keep their existing behavior, including import behavior. Scoped Tob does not gain Git/Zip/directory import, Marketplace search or edits to another Bot's existing Memory from this slice.

Scoped `show` returns `{bot, profileFingerprint}`. Before every `update`, `pause`, `resume`, `bot-avatar-set`, `bot-banner-set`, `bot-appearance-set` or `bot-primary-color-set`, read the target and pass that fingerprint using `--expected-profile`. Presentation commands retain their existing file/recipe/clear/color options. The fingerprint covers the complete Registry record, so a concurrent change to any recorded profile field invalidates the reviewed snapshot. The Host rechecks it after approval and before applying the existing owner operation, then returns the canonical profile and new fingerprint. Re-read after `stale-setting`; do not silently overwrite. Profile metadata updates are limited to name, description and tags, not Workspace Grants, credentials or model configuration. Human online `update` also requires `--expected-profile` from `show` and uses the same Host owner; a stale fingerprint is not silently refreshed. Use `--description ''` to clear the bio and `--role ''` to clear all tags.

```bash
deepseekbot bot-delete-preview <bot-id>
deepseekbot bot-delete-memory-folder <bot-id>
printf '%s' '{"token":"<preview.token>"}' | deepseekbot bot-delete-confirm <bot-id> --confirmation-stdin --confirm
# Only after explicitly reviewing erasure of the owner's displayed Memory folder:
printf '%s' '{"token":"<preview.token>"}' | deepseekbot bot-delete-confirm <bot-id> --confirmation-stdin --confirm --erase-memory
deepseekbot bot-delete-retry <bot-id> --confirm
```

Deletion retains Memory by default. `--erase-memory` selects the exact owner-reviewed Memory directory, only when `preview.eraseAvailable` permits it; caller-selected paths are rejected. `bot-delete-memory-folder` returns the validated `{target:{path,relativePath,kind}}` for inspection, not arbitrary filesystem access. Preview tokens, dependency scope and path ownership checks remain authoritative. Deletion retry continues the already accepted retention/erasure choice; it cannot change that choice. Scoped confirm and retry require a fresh Human decision each time, including under full access, remembered rules or automatic approval. Both Human commands now require `--confirm`, so update existing cleanup scripts. Tob itself cannot be archived or deleted (`protected-bot`), and names, personality text and imports never grant its authority.

See [ADR-0225](adr/0225-bot-creation-receipts-and-reviewed-profile-lifecycle.md) and the [coverage inventory](agents/cli-ui-coverage.md#2089-bot-management-scope). Direct CLI, actual Tob conversation, Web navigation and macOS Desktop are separate verification gates; these command contracts do not imply those runs have passed.

### Tob group creation and invitations

The first [#2090](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2090) slice lets Tob create groups and add existing Bots from its accepted Human DM. After the management operation is approved, invited Bots join immediately under the existing default `autoAcceptGroupInvites=true`; no separate invitation decision is needed. It uses the existing Channel owner through the scoped CLI, without a new model Tool. Tob manages other Bots and cannot be an initial member or invitation target.

```bash
deepseekbot channels --limit 25
deepseekbot channel <channel-id>
deepseekbot group-create "Research team" --member <bot-a> --member <bot-b> --operation-key group-research-001
deepseekbot group-create "Planning" --operation-key group-planning-001
deepseekbot group-invite <channel-id> --bot <bot-c> --operation-key invite-research-001 --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
```

Scoped `channels` returns bounded Channel metadata, not message bodies; use `--limit` from 1 to 100 (default 50) and the returned `nextCursor` with `--cursor`. `channel <group-channel-id>` returns `{channel, channelFingerprint, invitationPolicy:{autoAccept}, wakePolicies}` and refuses a non-group target. The scoped projection keeps at most 100 members, the last 100 invitations and the last 100 join requests, with counts for omitted entries. These reads do not admit Tob as a member or authorize group messages as management instructions.

`group-create` supports an empty group or repeated `--member` values for existing eligible Bots. Explicit initial members join directly, matching the existing Human/UI creation behavior. A later `group-invite` uses the existing invitation owner. With the default `autoAcceptGroupInvites=true`, it records an accepted invitation (`respondedBy: "profile-policy"`) and membership together, without waking the invited Bot for a separate decision. This adds no setting or UI toggle. Only if the Human has already disabled auto-accept does the existing pending-invitation decision flow apply. Tob preserves that choice and reports the returned state.

Scoped creation/invitation writes require a stable `--operation-key` of 8–128 letters, digits, dots, underscores, colons or hyphens, starting with a letter or digit; invitation also requires the `--expected-channel` fingerprint from the preceding read. The reviewed snapshot binds current Channel metadata, membership and invitation policy, plus the target Bot identity. Message arrivals and unread counters do not invalidate that snapshot. Approval and execution recheck the accepted Human DM and current target state. If a relevant setting changes while review is pending, read it again and submit a new proposal rather than refreshing the approved snapshot silently.

The keyed result includes a `receipt` with `operationKey`, `kind`, `channelId`, optional `invitationId` and completion `status`, alongside canonical Channel state and the invitation when applicable. The durable operation receipt reserves the Channel or invitation identity. After an uncertain response, repeat the **same command, key and payload** to reconcile that operation instead of selecting another key. A completed scoped replay reads back the existing result without asking for another mutation approval. Changed payloads, unavailable targets or changed Bot incarnations refuse; replay never recreates a deleted group or duplicates an invitation. Current authority is still required after a Shell or Host restart; the receipt does not preserve the expired Shell capability.

`stale-channel` or `stale-profile` requires a fresh read and review. `operation-key-conflict` means the key is already bound to different input. `channel-operation-unavailable`, `unknown-channel`, `unknown-bot` and `archived-bot` refuse unavailable identities; `protected-bot` refuses Tob as a target. An unavailable invitation returns `group-invite-unavailable`. These failures do not authorize a fallback command or a replacement identity.

Authenticated Human online `group-create` and `group-invite` also support stable operation keys; the invitation command accepts `--expected-channel` for the observed state. These review/retry inputs are optional for Human commands and mandatory for scoped Tob. Existing unkeyed Human operations retain their owner behavior.

The following slices add group rename/avatar, member wake settings, member removal, cancellation of pending invitations and decisions on pending join requests. Personal mute/pin/nickname/visibility, group deletion, attachments and external membership remain outside the scoped allowlist. Some already have Human CLI commands above; that does not grant Tob access. #2090 remains open for its remaining scope. See [ADR-0226](adr/0226-group-management-receipts-preserve-channel-authority.md) and the [coverage inventory](agents/cli-ui-coverage.md#2090-group-management-scope). Direct CLI, real Tob approval/readback, Web membership/history and macOS Desktop are separate verification gates.

### Tob group settings and member removal

From its accepted Human DM, Tob can use existing approval to change a group name, avatar or member wake policy for ordinary group messages, or remove a Bot member. It reuses the same Channel owner, authority and durable data, with no new model Tool, database migration or UI. Scoped `channel-rename` accepts groups only; it cannot rename a Bot DM.

```bash
deepseekbot group-wake-policies <channel-id>
deepseekbot channel-rename <channel-id> --name "Product research" --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
deepseekbot group-avatar-set <channel-id> --avatar-file ./avatar.png --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
deepseekbot group-avatar-set <channel-id> --clear --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
deepseekbot group-wake-set <channel-id> --bot <bot-id> --mode digest --count 5 --interval 30 --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
deepseekbot group-wake-set <channel-id> --bot <bot-id> --inherit --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
deepseekbot group-member-remove <channel-id> --bot <bot-id> --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
```

`group-wake-policies` returns the current group snapshot, `channelFingerprint` and each member's `{botSlug, inherited, policy}`. The fingerprint includes effective wake policies, including inherited Bot defaults: changing a default invalidates an older review. Message traffic and unread changes do not invalidate it. Scoped avatar reads/reviews expose presence, type, size and digest instead of image data.

Every write requires the observed `--expected-channel`; read again after each successful edit before preparing another. Names must be nonempty and at most 120 characters. Avatars use the bounded PNG/JPEG/WebP files described above, or `--clear`. Wake modes are `all`, `mentions`, `digest` and `silent`; `--count` is 1–100 and `--interval` is 1–3600 seconds, defaulting to 5/30. `--inherit` removes the group override and restores the Bot default. Member removal preserves the Bot identity, Memory, other Channels and group history. Removing the group owner clears its ownership, leaving Human management. An archived existing member can be removed; changing wake policy requires an active Bot.

Approval binds the previous state, exact target and proposed values. Execution rechecks the Human's current group access and target Bot identity. Denied/expired approval, a Human who has left, a non-group target, a missing membership or a replaced identity refuses without bypassing checks; Tob still cannot join groups. `stale-channel`/`stale-profile` requires a fresh read and review rather than overwriting a concurrent edit.

These edits do not accept `--operation-key` or add replay receipts. After an uncertain result, inspect `channel`/`group-wake-policies` before doing anything else; do not blindly retry. Any remaining change needs a new proposal against the current snapshot. Existing create/invite receipts and default automatic acceptance are unchanged. Authenticated Human online equivalents may supply `--expected-channel`; omission preserves existing behavior without weakening Tob's mandatory inputs. #2090 remains open for its undelivered scope; these contracts do not claim Web, real-model or macOS verification has passed.

### Tob invitation cancellation and join decisions

From its accepted Human DM, Tob can use existing approval to cancel one **pending** group invitation or accept/decline one **pending** join request. First read `channel <channel-id>` for the exact invitation/request ID, status and `channelFingerprint`, then propose the operation:

```bash
deepseekbot channel <channel-id>
deepseekbot group-invite-cancel <channel-id> --invitation <invitation-id> --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
deepseekbot group-join-decide <channel-id> --request <request-id> --accept --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
deepseekbot group-join-decide <channel-id> --request <request-id> --decline --expected-channel <channelFingerprint>
```

Scoped commands require the observed `--expected-channel`; a join decision requires exactly one of `--accept` or `--decline`. Approval binds the current group snapshot, exact pending record, target Bot incarnation and requested decision. Before execution, the Host rechecks the accepted Human DM, current Human membership, fingerprint, target identity and pending status. Denied/expired approval, a Human who has left, a concurrent decision or an unavailable/replaced target cannot authorize a mutation or silently refresh approved inputs.

`unknown-invitation`/`unknown-join-request` refuses an absent record; `invitation-not-pending`/`join-request-not-pending` refuses an already settled target. `stale-channel`/`stale-profile` requires another read and review. These refusals do not authorize a replacement target or a different action.

The default `autoAcceptGroupInvites=true` is unchanged: invited Bots normally join immediately, so cancellation cannot undo an already accepted invitation and never removes an existing member. Cancellation only applies to a still-pending invitation, such as one created after the Human opted out of automatic acceptance. Removing an existing member requires a separate reviewed `group-member-remove`; a failed cancellation must not fall back to removal.

The existing Channel owner persists membership and accepted status together for acceptance; decline does not add membership. It records the existing decision notification once. Tob does not join the group or accept its content as management authority. This slice reuses canonical status and notification handling without another model Tool, schema migration or operation receipt.

Authenticated Human online equivalents may provide `--expected-channel`; `group-join-decide` without it retains existing same-decision idempotent readback of a completed result. Scoped Tob entry points accept pending records only and cannot bypass fresh review by omitting the fingerprint or repeating a terminal decision. After an uncertain response, read the exact record's status and membership first. If it remains pending and action is still needed, propose against a fresh snapshot instead of blindly retrying. Personal presentation, group deletion and external membership remain separate delivery; this slice does not close #2090.

### Tob model and runtime management

Use `deepseekbot capabilities` inside Tob's eligible Shell execution to discover its current commands. The following commands reuse existing Host owners; writes still require the accepted Human DM and existing review policy.

```bash
deepseekbot list
deepseekbot model-catalog
deepseekbot model-plan <bot-id>
deepseekbot model-presets
deepseekbot settings

deepseekbot home-model-set --provider <provider-id> --model <model-id> [--orchestrator-effort <effort>] --expected-revision <default-revision>
deepseekbot model-plan-customize <bot-id> --orchestrator-provider <provider-id> --orchestrator-model <model-id> --expected-revision <plan-revision>
deepseekbot model-plan-inherit <bot-id> --expected-revision <plan-revision>
# Full plan JSON: orchestrator, assignmentDefault and assignmentModels.
deepseekbot model-plan-set <bot-id> --plan-stdin --expected-revision <plan-revision> < plan.json
# Assignment-only JSON omits orchestrator; the Bot must already have a plan.
deepseekbot model-plan-assignments-set <bot-id> --plan-stdin --expected-revision <plan-revision> < assignments.json
deepseekbot model-preset-apply <bot-id> --preset <preset-id> --expected-revision <plan-revision> --preset-revision <preset-revision>
```

`model-catalog` returns available models and `default`/`defaultRevision`; model-plan reads return the Bot plan revision. Changing the Host default preserves other Bots' independent overrides. Customize changes the Orchestrator while preserving Assignment choices; inherit returns the Bot to the Host default. The Host validates route availability both while preparing the operation and before execution. An unavailable route refuses with `model-unavailable`, while a changed reviewed revision refuses with `stale-setting`. Legacy plans requiring repair return `legacy-model-repair-required` rather than being silently rewritten. Credential setup remains native and private: use the existing model/credential interface; Tob receives catalog/readiness information, never credential values.

Preset create/read/update/application reuse the existing preset owner. Scoped `model-preset-create --name <name>` and `model-preset-update <preset-id> --name <name> --expected-revision <revision>` require explicit `--orchestrator-provider`, `--orchestrator-model`, `--assignment-provider` and `--assignment-model`; optional effort flags and `--plan-stdin` with `{"assignmentModels":[...]}` use the existing shapes. Scoped updates require the complete intended name and routes even though the Human command supports partial updates. Applying a preset checks both Bot and preset revisions. There is no preset deletion owner or command; this slice does not invent one or claim complete preset CRUD.

`settings` discovers the supported namespaces; `settings botharness-client` returns exactly four live runtime fields:

| Field                        | Accepted value |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| `assignmentConcurrencyLimit` | Integer 1–32   |
| `showBotSessions`            | Boolean        |
| `showApprovalReviewSessions` | Boolean        |
| `developerMode`              | Boolean        |

Use the paired reviewed flags with `settings-set botharness-client --patch-stdin`; the previous-value JSON must name exactly the patched fields. `settings agent-default-model` reads the default route; change it with `home-model-set`. Unknown fields, other namespaces and direct default-model patches refuse rather than editing configuration files. Motion, theme, language, shortcuts, layout and other preferences are not implied by this scope.

### Tob privacy, Git and updates

```bash
deepseekbot telemetry-status
deepseekbot telemetry-set --enabled
# Or: deepseekbot telemetry-set --disabled
deepseekbot git-status
deepseekbot git-install
deepseekbot release-info
deepseekbot release-check
deepseekbot release-install <version> --confirm
deepseekbot release-restart --confirm
```

These reuse the same telemetry, Git and release owners as Settings. Environment-locked telemetry cannot be overridden; inspect the returned effective/locked state rather than assuming the stored preference controls collection. Git covers availability and installation only, with no new global Git identity editor.

Scoped `release-install` and `release-restart` require explicit `--confirm` and a fresh Human decision for every invocation. Full access, remembered allow rules and automatic approval cannot replace that decision; the flag itself is not approval. `git-install` does not use `--confirm` and retains its existing review policy. Restart can interrupt running turns and disconnect the requesting CLI; do not automatically repeat an install or restart after an uncertain result. Reconnect and inspect release status before deciding another action. Test these operations only in an owned isolated Profile, preserving the Human's active Desktop.

### Recover an exhausted Group draft

After restarting the Host, inspect the draft, read the current Group, and pass both
`review_action: "recover"` and `freshness_override` with the current `draftVersion`,
fresh `observation_id`, original `draft_id`, and revised body to the same direct
`bot-tool ... channel_send --args-stdin` command. Recovery does not renew the two-recheck
budget or a spent explicit override. A changed context still refuses the final attempt.
A successful override retains a commit receipt; retrying its unchanged intent returns
the same message ID, including after another restart. Inspection cannot include
`freshness_override` or other mutation arguments.

### Cloud Agent connections (UAT)

`deepseekbot cloud list` reads public connection state from the selected live Host. Import an operator-trusted TOB Agent credential with `deepseekbot cloud import --input-stdin < /absolute/private-agent.json`; the Host qualifies its instance/channel/Agent identity before saving the secret in native Credentials. Do not paste credential values into command arguments. Imported accounts appear in `cloud list` and the existing Apps UI; explicitly bind the account to a local Bot through the existing `im-bind <bot> --app <cloud-id>` command/UI. Cloud import never selects a phone/CLI Human organization or creates a Bot.

`deepseekbot cloud policy --input-stdin` accepts `{ "id": "cloud-<fingerprint>", "revision": 1, "policy": { "allowedUsers": ["user_..."], "forwardTargets": [], "environment": "host-a" } }`. This records an explicit local work allow-list; it does not bypass native tool permissions. `deepseekbot cloud remove --input-stdin --confirm` accepts `{ "id": "cloud-<fingerprint>", "revision": 2 }`. Read the actual current revision first. Removal disables traffic before deleting the secret; `credentialRemoved: false` requires retrying cleanup. Two-Host execution and runtime evidence are tracked in #2155, not established by these command examples.

`deepseekbot cloud-work <bot> --input-stdin` invokes the same bounded `cloud_work` Tool as the Bot. Pass `{ "operation": "inspect", "source_event_id": "im-..." }` for the canonical request and configured forward targets. `execute` performs only the fixed runtime health check; `forward` additionally requires `target_actor_id` from those configured targets. The input cannot supply a Human identity, request body or shell command. Current source access, binding and local policy apply to every operation. Retry uncertain operations with the same source/operation/target: result delivery never repeats the local check, while interrupted execution reports `needs-review`. A forward attempt cannot fall back to execution. The fixed model-mediated two-Host UAT path and direct replay after both Host restarts are qualified at `f02c2423b`; this does not qualify arbitrary work or a fresh phone run.

## Desktop onboarding

`deepseekbot onboarding` reads the Profile journey and actual Bot/group result references. Use `--action start|pause|skip|continue|restart|finish` to change tutorial lifecycle. `finish` refuses before actual Bot/group creation. Restart preserves resources, approvals, layouts and history. Layout tip completion stays on the current Client; this command does not operate the UI or mark provider execution successful.

### Version-bound Memory images

`memory-file`, `memory-working-diff`, and `memory-commit-diff` include optional image metadata for PNG, JPEG/JPG, GIF, WebP and safe static SVG files. `source` identifies the working tree, index, or exact commit; `revision` binds the returned bytes. No image body is printed in JSON.

```bash
deepseekbot memory-image <bot-id> --path preview.png --image-source <source> --image-revision <revision> --out /absolute/new-preview.png
```

Markdown `.md` / `.markdown` results from `memory-file`, `memory-working-diff` and `memory-commit-diff` additionally expose a `markdown` document (or `before` / `after` documents): `source`, `revision` (SHA-256 of the document bytes), `status`, and the exact UTF-8 `body`. Diff previews have independent text budgets: 4 MiB per document and 4 MiB total document bodies per commit query; line-diff limits stay unchanged. No rendered HTML or image bodies enter these JSON results.

For an inline local image, pass the document's source/revision and the authored reference:

```bash
deepseekbot memory-image <bot-id> --path notes/guide.md --image-source <document-source> --image-revision <document-revision> --image-reference ../chart.png --out /absolute/new-chart.png
```

With `--image-reference`, `--path` names the Markdown document and `--image-revision` identifies that document, not the image. The receipt includes `reference`. Relative images resolve from the document directory, `/chart.png` from the Memory Repository root. Percent-encoded spaces/Unicode and in-root parent traversal work; root escape, `.git`, backslashes, URL schemes and symlink escape are refused. The route revalidates mutable document content before and after reading the image; index/commit images never fall back to the worktree. It returns the selected source's image at load time; refresh the view to observe later mutable image changes. External HTTPS images are a Client-only explicit-load action; the Host/CLI do not fetch external URLs.

Use the exact metadata from the selected file/diff side. The authenticated Host returns those original image bytes and their detected MIME, or a coded refusal such as `memory-image-stale`; refresh mutable metadata rather than substituting the current file. `--out` must be absolute and must not already exist. The command prints one JSON receipt. Preview limits are 25 MiB per image, 16,384 pixels per axis and 40 million decoded pixels. GIF/WebP keep their original animation within 256 frames and 40 million canvas pixels across all frames. SVG additionally allows at most 1 MiB UTF-8, 10,000 XML nodes, depth 64, 64 KiB CSS and 20,000 expanded nodes. The static SVG subset accepts ordinary shapes, text, CSS, gradients, markers, clipping and bounded internal references; scripts, event handlers, foreign HTML, images, filters, animation, external references, DTDs, processing instructions and reference cycles are refused. SVG stays an image resource, never inserted markup, and all successful exports preserve the original SVG bytes. Original-file download and Open current file remain separate actions.

## Desktop window zoom (controlled S1)

The product includes a separate opt-in configuration command. Install the product normally,
quit the target macOS Desktop, then point setup at that application's bundle and explicit
Profile. Setup uses the selected application's bundled pnpm with scripts disabled, under the
same Profile writer lock as the native plugin manager. It refuses a running Desktop Host,
other theme overrides, stale product composition and an app version other than 0.2.1-rc.2.
It changes one Profile dependency and never edits the installed application:

```sh
deepseekbot-zoom-setup enable --home <absolute-DSH_HOME> --profile desktop --desktop-app "/Applications/DeepSeek Harness.app"
deepseekbot-zoom-setup disable --home <absolute-DSH_HOME> --profile desktop --desktop-app "/Applications/DeepSeek Harness.app"
```

Keep Desktop closed until setup returns, then reopen it. A busy Profile or uncertain package
outcome requires inspection rather than automatic retry. For a non-Desktop isolated Profile,
use `--profile <profile> --dsh <qualified-dsh-cli>` instead. The DSH CLI intentionally refuses
the managed `desktop` Profile; the native plugin manager also refuses this plain-library
replacement, because it resolves the installation-owned theme before Profile Bundle metadata.
Those two paths do not establish Desktop activation.

Run `disable` before uninstalling the product and restart to restore native package resolution.
Manual font preferences remain in the same native `ui-theme` Patch. JSON stdout reports
`restartRequired:true` and `runtimeVerified:false`; a successful package change does not prove
the native window has loaded it. An uncertain package operation is not retried automatically.

`window-zoom-clients` lists active targets. Select one `--client-id`; commands never choose a
window implicitly. `window-zoom-get` reads the Client-owned snapshot. A write requires the
returned `document.revision` as `--expected-revision`:

```sh
deepseekbot window-zoom-clients --host <host> --token-file <private-file>
deepseekbot window-zoom-get --client-id <id> --host <host> --token-file <private-file>
deepseekbot window-zoom-set --client-id <id> --zoom-level=-1 --expected-revision <revision> --host <host> --token-file <private-file>
deepseekbot window-zoom-reset --client-id <id> --expected-revision <revision> --host <host> --token-file <private-file>
```

Levels are integers -8…8; the factor is `1.2 ** level`. Use `--zoom-default` with `window-zoom-set`
to save the device default and apply it to the current window. A normal set changes only the
current window; reset restores its saved default. Negative arguments use `--zoom-level=-1`.
The stable desktop origin stores this locally; the Host only relays requests. Browser Clients
and desktops without the qualified compatibility composition do not register targets.

`zoom-client-stale`, `zoom-client-unavailable`, `zoom-revision-conflict` and storage errors are
refusals, not successful fallback writes. A timeout/cancellation after delivery has an unknown
write outcome: read the same live Client before deciding what to do; never retry blindly.
Restarting the Client changes its delivery ID; list again. The desktop's primary-window state
survives independently. See [S1](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2268) for native
qualification limits. No model or Host-side preference copy is involved.

The Windows candidate uses the installed product's `deepseekbot-zoom-setup` command with
`--home <isolated-home> --profile desktop --desktop-app "<app-directory>/DeepSeek Harness.exe"`.
Keep the selected Desktop closed throughout `enable` or `disable`; setup refuses any running
process of that executable. Only FileVersion `0.2.1-rc.2` and a Windows-capable, hash-checked
theme payload are accepted. The native `ui-theme` row and font settings remain in place.
Run `disable` before removing the product. After every cold boot, enumerate Client IDs again.
Ctrl+0 restores the saved default, including 120%; numberpad codes are unsupported by the
pinned protocol. See [Windows qualification #2270](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2270)
for the separate native input, guest foreground, DPI and Human-QA gates.

## Hosted Connect tunnel (ADR-0241, first slice)

Hosted Connect lets a paired phone reach this Host through a Cloudflare Tunnel under
`deepseekbot.dev` instead of Tailscale ([#2387](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2387)).
In this first slice the tunnel and its connector token are made by hand; account sign-in and the
relay come later.

```sh
deepseekbot connect-status --host <host> --token-file <private-file>
deepseekbot connect-enable --hostname <name>.deepseekbot.dev --token-stdin --host <host> --token-file <private-file> < <connector-token-file>
deepseekbot connect-disable --host <host> --token-file <private-file>
```

`connect-enable` stores the hostname and connector token in the DSH credential store, opens a
loopback origin that forwards only `/botharness-device/*` to the DSH listener (every other path is
404), and runs `cloudflared tunnel --no-autoupdate run` with the token in `TUNNEL_TOKEN`, never in
its arguments. The JSON reply's `origin` is the address the tunnel's ingress must target. The
`cloudflared` binary comes from `DEEPSEEKBOT_CLOUDFLARED` or `PATH`. `connect-status` returns
`connect.state` (`off`, `starting`, `connected`, `error`) with `issue` (`cloudflared-missing`,
`cloudflared-exited`, `origin-port-busy`, `credential-unavailable`) and the phone route list; once
connected, new pairing QR codes include `https://<name>.deepseekbot.dev` after any Tailscale route.
Refusals: `connect-hostname-invalid` (only one label under `deepseekbot.dev`),
`connect-token-invalid`, `credential-unavailable`. `connect-disable` stops the tunnel and deletes
the stored token; paired devices keep their credentials.

### Account sign-in (second slice)

```sh
deepseekbot connect-sign-in --wait --host <host> --token-file <private-file>
deepseekbot connect-sign-out --host <host> --token-file <private-file>
```

`connect-sign-in` starts WorkOS CLI Auth (the device authorization grant) with the client that the
relay at `https://connect.botharness.ai` publishes (`DEEPSEEKBOT_CONNECT_RELAY` overrides it). The
reply carries `userCode` and `verificationUri`; with `--wait` the CLI prints them to stderr and waits
until the Host finishes. The Host then stores only the refresh token in the DSH credential store,
links itself to the account (at most five Hosts per account), asks the relay for its tunnel and runs
it as `connect-enable` would, with no hand-made token. While signed in it asks the relay again when
the tunnel stops, so a tunnel the relay reclaimed after the Host was offline comes back on the same
`<host-id>.deepseekbot.dev`. `connect-status` adds `connect.account` with `state` (`signed-out`,
`signing-in`, `signed-in`, `error`), `email`, `hostId` and `issue` (`relay-unavailable`,
`sign-in-denied`, `sign-in-expired`, `session-expired`, `account-not-allowed`, `host-limit`,
`credential-unavailable`). `connect-sign-out` unlinks the Host at the relay, stops the tunnel and
deletes the session. While testing, only allowlisted accounts can link Hosts.

## Device-local DeepSeekBot appearance

`appearance-clients` lists the online Client ids and platform on the authenticated Host. Select one explicitly; a new mount/reload gets a new id. This controls DeepSeekBot, not the DSH-native Host theme.

```bash
deepseekbot appearance-clients --host http://127.0.0.1:PORT --token-file /private/host-token
deepseekbot appearance-get --client-id CLIENT_ID --host http://127.0.0.1:PORT --token-file /private/host-token
printf '%s' '{"preference":"dark","mode":"dark","preset":"mist-purple","primary":"#9876cb"}' | deepseekbot appearance-set --client-id CLIENT_ID --expected-revision REVISION --patch-stdin --host http://127.0.0.1:PORT --token-file /private/host-token
```

Use `snapshot.config.revision` from the read as `REVISION`. Patch fields: `preference` is `light`, `dark` or `system`; `mode` is `light` or `dark` and is required with `preset` (`classic-blue` / `mist-purple`) or `primary` (six-digit hex). Selecting a preset resets that mode's Primary unless the same patch supplies another. Other mode and unknown future fields are retained.

A successful command emits one JSON document after the target Client acknowledges local storage; read it back and inspect the UI. Web persists per browser/site; Desktop per application regardless of Host. Other browser profiles and Desktop do not receive the command. Same-site tabs share local storage intentionally.

Refusals include `appearance-client-required`, `appearance-client-stale`, `appearance-client-unavailable`, `appearance-client-busy`, `appearance-client-timeout`, `appearance-revision-required`, `appearance-revision-conflict`, `appearance-invalid-input`, `appearance-storage-invalid` and `appearance-storage-unavailable`. A timeout after delivery has an unknown outcome: read again before retrying. There is no offline queue, broadcast, Host preference mirror or model call.

Global materials (T2): the four presets are `classic-blue`, `mist-purple`, `forest-green` and `warm-amber`. Add `materials.header` and/or `materials.body` to a mode patch; each accepts optional `color` (six-digit hex), `opacity` (0–100 percent) and `blur` (0–40 CSS pixels). Fields merge independently. Choosing a preset clears known global adjustments only for that mode. The same Client acknowledgment, revision checks and storage refusals apply.

```bash
printf '%s' '{"mode":"light","materials":{"header":{"color":"#e9ddf6","opacity":75,"blur":16},"body":{"opacity":80,"blur":12}}}' | deepseekbot appearance-set --client-id CLIENT_ID --expected-revision REVISION --patch-stdin --host http://127.0.0.1:PORT --token-file /private/host-token
```

Functional Panels (T3): `deepseekbot appearance-targets --client-id CLIENT_ID` reads the target catalog and snapshot from that Client (use the same Host/auth flags as above). IDs such as `dock:bh:channel-body` identify the Messages function, regardless of its selected Channel. `appearance-get` also returns `targets`.

Use `appearance-set` with `{"mode":"light","panel":{"id":"dock:bh:channel-body","materials":{"header":{"color":"#e0c1ed","opacity":42},"body":{"blur":8}}}}`. Send a field as `null` to follow global, for example `{"mode":"light","panel":{"id":"dock:bh:channel-body","materials":{"header":{"color":null}}}}`. Reset only that target/mode with `{"mode":"light","panel":{"id":"dock:bh:channel-body","reset":true}}`. Panel operations cannot mix global fields in the same patch. All writes require `--patch-stdin` and the last `--expected-revision`.

Target refusals are `appearance-target-unavailable`, `appearance-target-duplicate` and `appearance-target-invalid`; they never redirect to another Panel. Closing a Panel does not delete its override. Global preset changes retain it. Nested targets are introduced separately.

Nested appearance uses the same `appearance-targets` and `appearance-set` commands. Targets include registered Memory files/evolution, Browser/Computer and independent contributions; `dock:memory-details` is shared by file preview, commit detail and working changes. Use `dock:generated-files` for the Channel file side panel. Every omitted field follows the current mode's global setting directly, even inside a customized parent. A hidden panel keeps its appearance; an unregistered contribution refuses writes until it returns. Resetting a parent never clears child overrides.

### Device-local image wallpaper

Use `appearance-clients` to identify one online Web or Desktop Client, then `wallpaper-get --client-id <id>` to read its `wallpaper.revision`. Wallpaper revisions are separate from appearance revisions. All mutations require that exact `--expected-revision` (initially `empty`):

```bash
deepseekbot wallpaper-import --client-id <id> --expected-revision <revision> --file ./image.png
deepseekbot wallpaper-crop --client-id <id> --expected-revision <revision> --patch-stdin < crop.json
deepseekbot wallpaper-remove --client-id <id> --expected-revision <revision>
```

`crop.json` contains exactly `{ "x": 0.5, "y": 0.5, "zoom": 1.5 }`: center coordinates 0–1 and zoom 1–5. Import optionally accepts the same crop through `--patch-stdin`. The file is read on the CLI machine, must be a nonempty decodable image no larger than 20 MiB, and is transferred in ordered bounded chunks. Only the selected Client stores the original bytes. Successful stdout reports metadata and the new revision; no file path or media bytes are returned. Offline/stale Clients, revision conflicts, invalid media/crop, expired uploads and storage failures return coded refusals. A timeout after delivery requires a fresh read before retry; never automatically replay the import. Web and Desktop storage are independent, and neither is keyed by Host.

The same wallpaper commands also accept videos up to 100 MiB. Import must actually play/decode on the selected Client and generate a poster before committing; originals are not transcoded. `wallpaper-get` returns transient `playback.state` (`playing`, `paused`, `poster`, `inactive`) and a coded `reason` when degraded. The saved poster is used if playback fails or a later runtime cannot decode an accepted video. Image limits remain 20 MiB. Support is runtime/codec-specific; a successful transport alone does not prove playback.

Wallpapers form a library of up to 24 items. Import adds the media and shows it. `wallpaper-get` returns `wallpaper.library` with each item's `id`, `kind`, size and crop, the chosen `active` item and the rotation settings; `wallpaper.current` is the item on screen now.

```bash
deepseekbot wallpaper-select --client-id <id> --expected-revision <revision> --wallpaper-item <item-id|none>
deepseekbot wallpaper-remove --client-id <id> --expected-revision <revision> --wallpaper-item <item-id>
deepseekbot wallpaper-crop --client-id <id> --expected-revision <revision> --wallpaper-item <item-id> --patch-stdin < crop.json
echo '{"interval":900000,"shuffle":true}' | deepseekbot wallpaper-rotation --client-id <id> --expected-revision <revision> --patch-stdin
```

Without `--wallpaper-item`, crop and remove act on the item on screen. `none` keeps the library but shows no wallpaper. Removing the item on screen moves on to the next one. `interval` is `0` (off), `60000`, `300000`, `900000` (default), `1800000` or `3600000` milliseconds; `shuffle` picks a random order without repeating an item twice in a row. Rotation follows the clock, so every window of that Client shows the same item without extra writes. Full appearance reset empties the library.

### Appearance recovery

Read `appearance-get --client-id <id>` and `wallpaper-get --client-id <id>` first; their revisions are independent.

```bash
deepseekbot appearance-clear-panels --client-id <id> --mode light --expected-revision <appearance-revision>
deepseekbot appearance-reset --client-id <id> --expected-revision <appearance-revision> --expected-wallpaper-revision <media-revision> --confirm-reset
```

Clear removes all functional Panel overrides only in the explicit mode, including unregistered saved targets; theme/materials/Primary, the other mode, media and layout stay unchanged. Full reset requires `--confirm-reset`, defaults both palettes/mode/overrides, and removes shared media. It never changes DSH, Bot identity or business data. A preference write failure leaves media untouched. `appearance-reset-wallpaper-failed` means defaults were committed but media cleanup failed; reread both owners and retry with fresh revisions. The command does not claim a single transaction across localStorage and IndexedDB, nor automatically replay a delivered timeout.

### Three-action tool approval (#2080)

`tool-approval-decide ... --outcome allowed-always-tool` matches the Web card's Always allow: it approves the current call and persists the current tool in this Bot/role/authorization scope. Later different inputs match; another tool or changed scope does not. `tool-approval-rules` returns kind `tool`; `tool-approval-rule-revoke --confirm` restores prompting. Existing exact/broad/Secret rules are not reinterpreted. Permission/policy changes cannot be remembered; the Host returns a coded refusal for an unavailable Always allow action. Secret CLI keeps its program/account/variable-name restriction, and MCP service remembering keeps its independent access checks.

Full Access now retains native `ask` so recognized permission changes can reach the Human, while ordinary requests in its explicitly selected scope are automatically answered without routine cards. The selected mode/scope and existing Assignment permissions are not widened. A native `never` policy still means deterministic rejection; it is not bypassed. Directory grants still use `grant-request-approve --confirm`.
