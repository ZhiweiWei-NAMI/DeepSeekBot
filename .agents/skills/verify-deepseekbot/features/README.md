## Coverage and maintenance

| IM DM commands, current authority and canonical reply outcomes | no for commands; yes for ordinary follow-up | none (isolated Host, CLI and authorized native IM path) | [im-dm-commands.md](im-dm-commands.md) |

The index routes verification; it is not a list of features proven on the current commit.
Some files contain manual paths or API-only journeys. Read each file's preconditions and
limits. Native journeys run only through the [shared device QA queue](../../../../docs/agents/device-qa.md).
After a failed drive use [observation](../references/observation.md) before retrying.

Run `node scripts/verification-report.mjs` for the complete behavior/script inventory and
selected runtime evidence. See the [coverage report guide](../../../../docs/agents/verification-inventory.md)
for metrics, evidence selection and contributor requirements.

Run `node scripts/check-feature-map.mjs` for reference and inventory integrity.
The check fails for a missing feature row, required section, local link or script, and when
an index row's scripted journeys disagree with its feature file. It runs in lint. Passing
checks only reference integrity: update and run the affected paths when the product changes.

| Cloud Agent Host connections | yes for Agent response; no for credential management | isolated Host plus real TOB UAT, two Hosts for collaboration | [cloud-host-connections.md](cloud-host-connections.md) |
| IM conversation mirroring and forwarding settings | no for settings; yes for a model-generated reply | `verify-app` settings path; real IM destination required for delivery | [im-conversation-mirroring.md](im-conversation-mirroring.md) |
| Memory working and commit diffs | no | `scripts/e2e-memory-diff-wrap.mjs` | [memory-diffs.md](memory-diffs.md) |

## Not mapped yet

Legacy issue-era journeys often expect a prepared Host, fixed port or seeded fixture. Being
present under `scripts/` does not make a journey current or safe to run indiscriminately.
Prioritize gaps touched by the current PR; add a map entry after its path works against an
isolated instance, with the visible result and canonical read described.

Known gaps include standalone Activity Center/Inbox workflows, broader Memory recovery,
desktop Browser/Computer lifecycle and IM connection/delivery. Some have partial
coverage inside other feature files and CLI commands, but no complete feature-map entry.
The unmapped inventory is a discovery list, not a claim that each script is broken.

Historical failures from 2026-10-14 (not requalified by this audit):

- `scripts/e2e-activity-entry.mjs` passed login, then timed out on `.bh-overview` behind onboarding.
- `scripts/e2e-harvest.mjs` needed a model reply and timed out without one.
